John Snow

John Snow (15 March 1813 – 16 June 1858) was an English physician. He used anaesthesia and medical hygiene. He is a founder of modern epidemiology because he traced the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854. His findings caused changes in the water and sewage systems of London. This led to similar changes in other cities, and a great improvement in general public health around the world.
In 1837 Snow began working at the Westminster Hospital. Admitted as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 2 May 1838, he graduated from the University of London in December 1844 and was admitted to the Royal College of Physicians in 1850.
Anaesthesia.
Snow was one of the first to study dosages for the use of ether and chloroform as surgical anaesthetics. This let patients to undergo surgery and obstetrics without distress and pain. He personally administered chloroform to Queen Victoria when she gave birth to the last two of her nine children, Leopold in 1853 and Beatrice in 1857. This lead to wider acceptance of obstetric anaesthesia.
Cholera.
Snow did not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of 'foul air'. By talking to local residents, he found the source of the outbreak was the public water pump on Broad Street (now Broadwick Street). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the Broad Street pump did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough. The local council disabled the well pump by removing its handle. This action is usually credited with ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline:
There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it.
Snow also showed that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering the water to homes, so causing the cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology.
Snow died young after a stroke. Health in Victorian London was vastly improved by engineering works for sewage treatment and water supply. This included building huge pipes under ground which kept sewage and water supplies separate. This system was so successful that it lasted until the later part of the 20th century. Victorian London became one of the few large cities in the world to be free of epidemics carried by the water supply.

A Christmas tree plundering (Swedish: "Julgransplundring" 
 
) is a tradition in Sweden on St. Knut's Day (13 January). It means the end of the Christmas and holiday season. The Christmas and holiday season has then spanned across Advent Sunday, Saint Lucy's Day, Christmas, New Year and Epiphany. In private homes, especially children often have a party. They dance around the Christmas tree and smash the gingerbread house into pieces. The Christmas decorations are then put aside. Such parties are even common at schools, Kindergartens, churches and other associations. In many towns the public Christmas tree is taken out of usage for the bypassed Christmas by holding an outdoor Christmas tree plundering. The tradition originates from the Nordic region. It has changed very little since the 1870s.

Jean-Paul Joseph-Louis Parisé (December 11, 1941 – January 7, 2015) was a Canadian ice hockey coach and left winger. He played 17 years in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Boston Bruins, Minnesota North Stars, Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Islanders, and the Cleveland Barons. His son Zach currently plays for the Minnesota Wild.
Career.
Before playing in the NHL, Parisé played 38 games with the Niagara Falls Flyers of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), 65 games with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL), and two seasons with the Minneapolis Bruins of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL).
Parisé made his NHL debut in the 1965–66 NHL season with the Boston Bruins. He would only play 3 games with them that season and 18 games the next.
When the 1967–68 NHL season started, there was an expansion and expansion draft. Parisé was drafted by the Oakland Seals on June 6, 1967. On October 12, the Seals traded him along with Bryan Hextall Jr. to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Gerry Ehman. The Maple Leafs would assign Parisé to the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League (AHL). He ended up playing 30 games with the Americans and 1 games for the Maple Leafs. 
On December 23, the Maple Leafs traded him along with Milan Marcetta to the Minnesota North Stars in exchange for Murray Hall, Ted Taylor, Len Lunde, Don Johns, Duke Harris, and the loan of Carl Wetzel. He had his most success during his time with the North Stars. Parisé would play on a line with Jude Drouin and Bill Goldsworthy. He would play six seasons and parts of two others with the North Stars. He played in two NHL All-Star Games, and had his best professional season in the 1972–73 season, scoring a career high 27 goals and 75 points.
On January 5, 1975, the North Stars decided to trade the aging Parisé to the New York Islanders in exchange for Doug Rombough and Ernie Hicke. While he was with the Islanders, he was able to help them reach their first playoff berth that season and was also able to help them reach the Stanley Cup semifinals, where they were defeated in a seven game series by the eventual Stanley Cup champions Philadelphia Flyers.

After the Barons merged with the North Stars, Parisé became a North Star again. He was named the team's captain in the 1978–79 season. It would end up being his last season and he retired from playing professional ice hockey after it was over.
Death.
On January 7, 2015, Parisé died from lung cancer at his home in Prior Lake, Minnesota.

Minor (law)

A minor is a person under age of majority, drinking age, voting age or age of consent. They are also called underage. The age of majority depends on jurisdiction, though it is usually 18. "Minor" may be also used for other reasons. For example, in most of the United States, it is against the law for anyone 20 and under to drink or have alcoholic beverages, such as beer.
In Australia, Ireland and United Kingdom, the drinking age is 18.
In Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea, anyone under age 20 is a minor unless emancipated.

Spire

A spire is a tapering conical or pyramidal structure on the top of a building, particularly a church tower. Etymologically, the word comes from the Old English word "spir", meaning a sprout, shoot, or stalk of grass.
Symbolically, spires have two effects. One is to show strength and power. A spire, with its spear point, gives the impression of strength. The other is to reach up toward the skies as a religious gesture. This is one reason for its association with religious buildings, and a similar reason has been given for the large pyramids in Egypt and early American civilisations. However, the tallest spires today are secular places of business or hotels, such as The Shard.
As an architectural ornament, spires are most often found on Christian churches.

Regnal year

A regnal year is a year of the reign of a monarch. It is from the Latin "regnum" meaning kingdom or rule. Some of the oldest dating systems were in regnal years. A regnal year usually begins on the date of a monarch's accession to the throne. Year one is counted from day one to the end of the first year of a monarch's reign. Then a second year of rule, a third, and so on. They would not have a zero year of rule. It is displayed as an ordinal, not a cardinal number.
Date problems.
Every year of a monarch's reign falls within two calendar years, unless the reign began on the first day of the calendar year. When converting a regnal year in history to a calendar year, this can cause an error of one year. In England, from the 10th century until the late 13th century, the practice was to count the regnal year from the date of coronation. This was usually a later date than when a monarch was proclaimed king or queen. The current practice of dating from the date of accession began in the late 13th century when the heir was out of the country. Henry III of England died on 16 November 1272 which some sources date as the beginning of Edward I of England's rule. His reign actually began when he was proclaimed king at the New Temple on 20 November 1272. Here the date error between sources would be only four days.

<doc id="477122" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477122" title="Kestrel">
Kestrel

The name kestrel is given to several different members of the falcon genus, "Falco". Kestrels hover about 10 – over open country, and swoop down on prey, usually small mammals, lizards or large insects. Other falcons are more adapted to active hunting on the wing. In addition, kestrels have much brown in their plumage.
Kestrels can fly in stationary air, even indoors in barns. While hovering they face towards any slight headwind. This leads to the common kestrel being called a "windhover" in some areas.
Unusually for falcons, plumage often differs between male and female, although as usual with monogamous raptors the female is slightly larger than the male. This allows a pair to eat slightly different prey on their home range. Kestrels are bold, and have adapted well to humans. They nest in buildings and hunt by main roads. Kestrels do not build their own nests, but use nests built by other birds.
Most kestrels form a distinct clade among the falcons, as suggested by comparison of mtDNA cytochrome "b" sequence data and morphology. This clade diverged from other "Falco" around the Miocene to Pliocene about 7–3.5 million years ago (mya). The most basal "true" kestrels are three species from Africa and its surroundings.
About 2.5–2 mya, the main lineage of true kestrels emerged. This too seems to have evolved in Africa and subsequently spread across the Old World until they reached Australia some time during the Middle Pleistocene, less than one million years ago. This group contains several taxa found on Indian Ocean islands. A group of three mainly grey species from Africa and Madagascar are usually considered kestrels by their general shape and habits, but are probably distinct from the true kestrels discussed above.
There is only one kestrel in the Americas, with a wide range of habitats. It is "Falco sparverius". The male is more brightly coloured than usual for kestrels, with a reddish back and tail.

Cytochrome

Cytochromes are haemoproteins (or proteins containing haem groups). They make ATP by electron transport.
They are found either as single (monomeric) proteins (e.g., cytochrome c) or as part of bigger enzyme complexes which catalyze redox reactions.
The haem group does the redox reactions. These include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed. In general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons.
History.
Cytochromes were described in 1884 as respiratory pigments. They include (haemoglobin, myoglobin, haemocyanin, haemoerythrin and chlorocruorin. In the 1920s, Keilin rediscovered these respiratory pigments. He called them the cytochromes, or “cellular pigments”, and classified them as haem proteins.
Types.
Several kinds of cytochrome exist and can be distinguished by spectroscopy. Three types of cytochrome are distinguished by their prosthetic groups.
In mitochondria and chloroplasts, these cytochromes are often combined in electron transport and related metabolic pathways.

Ramsey theory

The Ramsey theory is named after the British mathematician and philosopher Frank Ramsey (1903–1930). It is a branch of mathematics that studies the conditions under which order must appear. 
Examples.
A typical result in Ramsey theory starts with some mathematical structure that
is then cut into pieces. How big must the original structure so that at least one of the pieces has a given interesting property? This idea can be defined as partition regularity.
For example, consider a complete graph of order "n"; that is, there are "n" vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. A complete graph of order 3 is called a triangle. Now colour every edge red or blue. How large must "n" be in order to ensure that there is either a blue triangle or a red triangle? It turns out that the answer is 6. 
Another way to express this result is as follows: at any party with at least six people, there are three people who are either (a) mutual acquaintances (each one knows the other two) or (b) mutual strangers (each one does not know either of the other two). 
Ramsey theory is now a complete branch of mathematics.

Captivity narrative

Captivity narratives are stories of people captured by enemies who are not civilized. Historians do not trust all of these stories. A lot of them are not written from a neutral point of view. Some historians that study Native American cultures are careful when they use these stories as sources.
Captivity narratives from North America were published through the 18th and 19th centuries. They are a part of English literature, and more stories were written in India and East Asia later on.
Background.
Colonists in New England were often captured by Canadians and their Indian allies. This was because New France and New England had competition at the time. (This happened to the Canadians as well). The number of captives taken from the fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries are unclear, however. Some think that about 1,641 New Englanders were taken hostage during King Phillip's War (1675). When the whites and Indians had conflicts in the mid-nineteenth century, hundreds of women and children were captured.

Desert Island Discs is a biographical and factual radio programme produced by Bob Symes. It is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the United Kingdom. It was first broadcast on the BBC Home Service on 29 January 1942.
Each week a person (called a "castaway") is asked to choose eight pieces of music, a book and a luxury item that they would take if they were to be cast away on a desert island (an island that is not lived on by humans). They discuss their lives and the reasons for their choices.
More than 3,000 episodes have been recorded. There aren't that many castaways, though, because a few castaways have appeared more than once. Some programmes had two people as the castaway.
The programme was created by Roy Plomley. After Plomley's death in 1985, the programme was presented by Michael Parkinson. From 1988 to 2006, it was presented by Sue Lawley.

When the town was rebuilt, stone houses became more common than wooden houses. Birchtrees were planted between the streets. This was because birchtrees are thought to not catch fire so easy. This has led to Umeå becoming known as the "town of birchtrees" (Swedish: "Björkarnas stad" 
 
). The same day a fire also occurred in the town of Sundsvall.

Amoeboid movement

Amoeboid movement is the most common type of movement in eukaryotic cells. 
It is a crawling type of movement got by pushing out cell cytoplasm in the form of pseudopodia ("false feet"). The cytoplasm slides and forms a pseudopodium in front to move the cell forward. 
This type of movement is observed in amoebae, slime molds and some other protozoans such as "Naegleria gruberi", as well as some cells in humans such as white blood cells. Sarcomas, or cancers arising from connective tissue cells, are particularly good at amoeboid movement, thus leading to their high rate of metastasis.
The exact mechanism is still unknown. It involves actin-myosin molecules inside the cytoplasm.

Sui iuris

Sui iuris is a Latin phrase that is used in law. Sometimes, the phrase is also spelled sui juris. It literally means "of its own right". It is used to say that the legal status of an institution or entity is not comparable to anything else, and there are special laws that say how this institution or entity should work. An example use is in Canon law: The Roman Catholic church say that certain churches are "sui iuris". That way the Eastern Catholic churches have their own government, and laws. Despite this, these churches still recognize the Pope of Rome as their spiritual leader.
"The Eastern Catholic Churches are not 'experimental' or 'provisional' communities; these are sui iuris Churches; One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic, with the firm canonical base of the "Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches" promulgated by Pope John Paul II." 
In Roman law, the phrase is used for someone who was independent, and that could become pater familias.

Parity of zero

Parity of zero is the question whether the number zero is even or odd. General consensus is that the number is even. Even numbers are defined to be integer multiples of two. That way, the numbers two, four and six are even, because they are one times two, two times two, and three times two. With that explanation, zero is also even, because it is zero times two. 
Another explanation is from number theory: The integers are arranged in such a way that even numbers are followed by odd ones, and odd ones by even ones. Zero is preceded by minus one, and followed by one. Both numbers are odd. So it must be even.
There is also a problem: The term "even" meaning "integer multiple of two" is a convention; people agreed on it. It is not a formal definition. Another case where people used a convention they agreed on was that of prime number: Before the 20th century, there were many inconsistent definitions of prime: Mathematicians such as Goldbach, Lambert, Legendre, Cayley, and Kronecker wrote that 1 was prime. The modern definition of "prime number" is "positive integer with exactly 2 factors", so 1 is not prime. This definition is rational: it naturally suits mathematical theorems that concern the primes. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is easier to state when 1 is not considered prime
It would be possible to redefine "even" in a way that no longer includes zero. However, in this case, the new definition would make it more difficult to state theorems concerning the even numbers. Already the effect can be seen in the algebraic rules governing even and odd numbers. The most relevant rules concern addition, subtraction, and multiplication:
Inserting appropriate values into the left sides of these rules, one can produce 0 on the right sides:
The above rules would therefore be incorrect if zero were not even. At best they would have to be modified. For example, one test study guide asserts that even numbers are characterized as integer multiples of two, but zero is "neither even nor odd". Accordingly, the guide's rules for even and odd numbers contain exceptions:
Making an exception for zero in the definition of evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers. From another perspective, taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that they continue to hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero.

White's illusion

White's illusion is a brightness illusion. Here, some stripes of a black and white grating are replaced by gray rectangles (see Fig). All gray bars usually have same color and opacity. The brightness of the gray pieces appear to shift toward the brightness of the top and bottom bordering stripes, that is, the gray bars with horizontal black regions on their top and bottom appear darker and those with white regions on their top and bottom appear lighter. But this does not match with what lateral inhibition predicts. This illusion is mostly described for grayscale. A similar illusion occurs for colored patches. This is known as Munker-White's illusion or Munker's illusion.
Lateral inhibition result for White's effect.
The amount of each bipolar cell response depends on the amount of the stimulation it receives from the receptor. Neighboring cells decrease this response. This is called lateral inhibition.
Lateral inhibition cannot explain White's illusion. In Figure 2.1 lateral inhibition sent by black cells A and C should make cell O lighter; in Figure 2.2 lateral inhibition sent by white cells A and C should make cell O darker.
Rules suggested to describe optical illusions such as simultaneous brightness contrast illusion, such as Wallach's ratio rule cannot explain White's illusion. These rules suggest that cell O in figure 2.1 receives less inhibition that cell O in figure 2.2. So, the cell O in figure 2.1 should be lighter than cell O in the other figure. However, the opposite case happens. 
White and White (1985) concluded that at a higher spatial frequency the grating of White's illusion could be described by brightness assimilation. They also concluded that at lower spatial frequencies White's illusion is still present.
Belongingness.
The belongingness theory has been given as an explanation of White's illusion. Belongingness means that we perceive things depending on its surroundings. According to belongingness theory, the lightness of rectangle A is influenced by the white bars that surround it. Similarly, the rectangle B on the right side is surrounded by the dark bars. So, the lightness of rectangle B is affected by the dark background. As a result, area A which rests on the white background appears darker than area B which rests on the dark background.
Not all scientists accept the belongingness theory. They say that when talking about the background, it is the same as lateral inhibition.

Lateral inhibition

In neurobiology, lateral inhibition is the ability of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors. It stops action potentials from spreading in the lateral direction. It is called lateral inhibition as it stops (inhibits) neighboring neurons from firing. This creates a contrast in stimulation. This increases perception. For example, in vision, it helps in differentiating edges. It occurs primarily in visual processes. But it has also been seen in tactile, auditory, and even olfactory processing. Cells that use lateral inhibition are mainly present in cerebral cortex and thalamus. They make up lateral inhibitory networks (LINs). Artificial sensory systems have artificial lateral inhibition built in them. Examples are vision chips, hearing systems, and optical mice.

Adventure fiction

Adventure fiction is a type of fiction in which an adventure forms the main storyline. The adventure is usually an exciting undertaking involving risk and physical danger. Author John G. Cawelti describes adventure fiction as the story "of the hero—individual or group—overcoming obstacles and dangers and accomplishing some important and moral mission." The characters in an adventure fiction are highly sympathetic. They are also ones the reader can easily relate to. There has to be a conflict to overcome and a clever villain to stop.
The hero.
A key part of many adventure fictions is the hero. In most stories the hero has to succeed. At the same time the hero may be the least interesting character in the story. The hero is often timid, submissive and easily pushed around. The hero may be a superhero, a spy, a detective or even an antihero. But the hero manages to meet the challenge. All great adventure heroes seem to find the ability to beat their enemies or win over hostile environments. 
Sometimes the villain wins. In Edgar Allan Poe's story "The Cask of Amontillado", the villain is the narrator of the story. Sometimes the villain wins only to be confronted again in a sequel.
The genre.
In many adventure fictions, the adventure takes place in foreign lands or exotic places. One of the earliest adventure fiction writers was Daniel Defoe. His stories of "Robinson Crusoe" and "Captain Singleton" helped set the standards for the adventure fiction genre. Another British author Sir Walter Scott built on the formula. He combined history with adventure fiction. His historical romance novels "Waverley", "Rob Roy" and "Ivanhoe" were classic adventures. They helped the reader understand the hero and gave him a code of chivalry. French author Alexandre Dumas wrote "The Three Musketeers", "The Count of Monte Cristo" and "Man in the Iron Mask". These were very popular in Europe and America. His stories had strong elements of revenge and forgiveness. James Fenimore Cooper in his adventure stories "The Pioneers", "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Pathfinder" were set in exotic new world locations. But Cooper changed the aristocratic hero into one who was noble even though not born into the nobility.

Anthony Trollope

Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) was an English novelist who wrote 47 novels and a number of other books. 
His mother Frances Trollope was also a writer. Trollope became an official of the Post Office and lived in Ireland from 1841 to 1859; he left his Post Office job in 1867.
Trollope is well known for his series of novels set in the imaginary county of Barsetshire. His first novel was published in 1847 and "The Warden", the first Barsetshire novel, in 1855. The rest of the series were published during the next 12 years: "The Barchester Chronicles" (1857), "Doctor Thorne" (1858), "Framley Parsonage" (1861), "The Small House at Allington" (1864), and "The Last Chronicle of Barset" (1867). Barsetshire is imagined as a county in southwest England. The county town is Barchester, which is the seat of the Bishop of Barchester. 
Trollope also wrote a series of political novels featuring the Palliser family. These began in 1864 with "Can You Forgive Her?". The rest of the series is "Phineas Finn" (1869), "The Eustace Diamonds" (1873), "Phineas Redux" (1876), "The Prime Minister" (1876), and "The Duke's Children" (1880). Trollope was an industrious and disciplined writer who wrote short stories, travel books and biographies as well as novels.

Sterling silver is an alloy of silver containing 92.5% by mass of silver and 7.5% by mass of other metals, usually copper. The sterling silver standard has a minimum of 925 in continental European terms.
Pure silver, for example 99.9% pure, is generally too soft for making objects for use. Therefore, the silver is usually alloyed with copper to give it strength while keeping the ductility and beauty of the precious metal. Other metals can replace the copper, to improve various properties of the basic sterling alloy such as increasing resistance to tarnish. These replacement metals include germanium, zinc and platinum, as well as a variety of other additives, including silicon and boron. Alloys such as argentium silver have appeared in recent decades. Argentium silver has some germanium added, and resists tarnishing well.
The first legal definition of sterling silver appeared in 1275. A statute of Edward I specified that 12 ounces of silver for coinage should contain 11 ounces 2+ pennyweights of silver and 17+ pennyweights of alloy, with 20 pennyweights to the Troy ounce.
Sterling silver standards are protected by hallmarks stamped on pieces by officials.

Pike Place Fish Market

The Pike Place Fish Market is an open air fish market located in Seattle, Washington at the corner of Pike Street and Pike Place. It is known for their tradition of fishmongers throwing fish that customers have purchased, before they are wrapped. After nearing bankruptcy in 1986, the fish market owner and employees decided to become "world famous", changing their way of doing business by introducing their flying fish, games, and customer performances. Four years later, they were featured repeatedly in the national media and television shows. The store is now a popular tourist destination in Seattle, attracting up to 10,000 daily visitors, and is often billed as world-famous.
History.
The Pike Place Fish Market was purchased in 1965 by John Yokoyama. Yokoyama was a former employee of the fish market, who bought the store to make enough money to afford the car payments on his new Buick Riviera. At first, Pike Place Fish Market was unknown outside of the Seattle area. Yokoyama and his staff decided to change that in a meeting with a business coach in 1986. Prior to the meeting, the Pike Place Fish Market was near to bankruptcy. Consultant, Jim Bergquist, was helping them to conceive of ways to save the business. A fish market employee at the meeting suggested that they not only save the business, but make it "world famous". They had the idea of flying and throwing fish and having games with customers. They thought that staff were enjoying their work so that customers would as well. In an interview, Yokoyama stated, "We took a stand that we were going to become world famous. We just said it and it became so."
Four years later, in 1990, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games were held in Seattle. News crews at the Pike Place Market discovered the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on "Good Morning America". The business and its employees were being filmed by various film crews, and being featured in many magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front of as many as 10,000 visitors daily. The success of the business has been cited to its human resources and employee attitudes. The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on ways to be successful. This has led to their being featured in motivational books.
A popular feature at the Pike Place Fish Market is a fish which sometimes is made to "snap" at customers. In 1991, CNN named the Pike Place Fish Market as one of the three most fun places to work in America.
Flying fish.
The Pike Place Fish Market is best known for their habit of hurling customers' orders across the shopping area. A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish, with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order, which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff, at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer's fish behind the counter for wrapping. Initially, the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee, but was enjoyed by customers, so it became a tradition. While working, the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish. At times, the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders, or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss. Above the areas in which they throw fish, the market hangs a sign that reads, "Caution: Low Flying Fish".
Films, books and popular culture.
In 1998, the Pike Place Fish Market was the subject of a documentary film and accompanying book, "FISH! Philosophy." The Pike Place Fish Market has also been the setting for several best-selling corporate training videos, the aforementioned "FISH!", and also "FISH!Sticks", which have been used by firms such as Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Sprint Nextel, Southwest Airlines, Sainsbury's, Saturn, and Scottish and Southern Energy, for employee training. The Pike Place Fish Market has been featured in a variety of television shows and commercials. These include a Spike Lee Levis jeans commercial; MTV's "The Real World"; NBC's "Frasier", and ABC's "Good Morning America". In films, they have appeared in "Free Willy".

Pietra dura

Pietra dura is a term for using cut and fitted, highly polished colored stones to create images. 
The stonework is glued stone-by-stone to a base after being "sliced and cut in different shape sections; and then assembled together so precisely that the contact between each section was practically invisible". Stability was got by grooving the undersides of the stones so that they interlocked, rather like a jigsaw puzzle, with everything held in place by an encircling 'frame'. Many different colored stones, particularly marbles, were used, along with semiprecious, and even precious stones. 
The technique first appeared in Rome in the 16th century. It reached its peak in Florence. Pietra dura items are generally crafted on green, white or black marble base stones. Typically the resulting panel is completely flat, but some examples have the image is in low relief.
There are a number of similar techniques which should not be called pietra dura. The English term "Florentine mosaic" is sometimes used for the work of Giovanni Montelatici (1864-1930). He was an Italian Florentine artist whose brilliant work has been distributed across the world by tourists and collectors.
Pietra dura is also different from mosaics becase stones are mostly much larger and cut to a shape suiting their place in the image, not all of roughly equal size and shape as in mosaic. In pietra dura, the stones are not cemented together with grout, and works in pietra dura are often portable. Nor should it be confused with micromosaics, a form of mosaic using very small tesserae of the same size to create images for Byzantine icons, and later for furniture panels.

Pink cat

Cats can be many different breeds and fur coat colours. A pink cat is not a colour found in nature. But several pink cats have been reported about in the news media. Sometimes the cat colour has changed to pink with chemicals or dyes. There are also several fictional pink cats in popular culture.
Real pink cats.
In September 2005, a cat named Brumas roamed away from his owners in Launceston, Cornwall. When he came back after a short time, his fur was coloured pink. No one ever figured out the cause of the colour change. Brumas was taken to the RSPCA to be tested. He did not have any toxins.
In September 2010, a cat with dyed pink fur was found in Swindon, South West England. The RSPCA said the dyeing was a "sick prank". Even though they tried to wash the colour out of the cat's fur, it stayed pink. The cat did not have any signs of side-effects or harm. The event made worldwide news. Soon the owner told the truth. She said that the cat had been dyed pink using food colouring because she was a fan of the colour. She said the act "seemed like a good idea. I always wanted a pink animal - a bit like my hair". She said she read the instructions carefully and the food colouring could not be harmful because it was safe for humans to eat. The RSPCA decided not to arrest her for harming her animal.
In May 2011, four kittens were found in a concrete factory in Redruth, Cornwall. One kitten had pink fur. A cat rescue group named "Cats Protection", tried to wash out the colour with shampoo, but could not.
Pollution from a steel factory in Port Talbot, Wales, has turned cats both pink and grey.
Fictional pink cats.
The Pink Panther is a cartoon cat that was created by Friz Freleng. He is seen in the opening titles of the Peter Sellers movies with his own theme music. He also had his own cartoon show. Animation historian Jerry Beck has said the cartoon cat is "anti-authority – he's cool yet he's pink".
The character of the children's television series" Bagpuss" was a pink cat. The Bagpuss puppet was really supposed to be an orange marmalade colour. When the puppet was made, it was dyed pink by mistake. 
Another children's television show, "Roobarb and Custard", had a pink cat named Custard. Roobarb, the dog, was yellow. This program was shown on BBC television in England. The characters acted similar to the animated cat and mouse, "Tom and Jerry."
In 2014, a Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman, made a 30 ft tall pink cat for an exhibition in Century Park, Shanghai.

Assist (football)

In association football, an assist is a pass or a cross by a player which helps to score a goal. Most commonly, an assist is given to a player for passing or crossing the ball to the scorer. It may also be awarded to a player whose shot rebounds (off a defender, goalkeeper or goalpost) to a teammate who scores. Some systems may give an assist to a player who wins a penalty kick or a free kick for another player to score. An attacking player for contributing to an own goal can also get an assist. A goal may be unassisted, or have one assist. In some systems, even two assists is possible.

 or ""'felkelés 
 
""') was a spontaneous nationwide revolt. It was against the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and its Soviet-imposed policies. It lasted from 23 October until 10 November 1956. It was the first major threat to Soviet control since the USSR's forces drove out the Nazis at the end of World War II and took over Eastern Europe. Despite the failure of the uprising, it was highly influential. It played a role in the fall of the Soviet Union decades later.
Prelude.
At the end of World War II Hungary was liberated from the Nazis. It was occupied by the Soviet Union’s Red Army. Hungary's communists were led by General Secretary Mátyás Rákosi and backed by Joseph Stalin. The communists destroyed all political opposition. In 1949 Hungary officially became the People’s Republic of Hungary. Rákosi was an oppressive ruler. He exiled, imprisoned or killed over 300,000 Hungarians. After Stalin died, the soviet communists replaced Rákosi with Imre Nagy. They felt his softer approach would win them popularity. But the Kremlin decided he had become too popular. Rákosi was returned to power in April 1955. His secret police, the AVO, carried out Rákosi's oppressive orders again. The Hungarian people grew more and more tired of communist rule.
When it broke out in October 1956, the Hungarian revolt was a sudden explosion. It wasn't organized by any group. Nobody had any idea it would sweep the country and break out everywhere all at once. However there were warning signs that trouble was coming. The Communist Party in Hungary had lost much of its authority and respect. In July of 1956 Rákosi was removed again as leader of the party. He was sent back to the Soviet Union.
Results.
Thousands of Hungarians died and thousands were imprisoned. Hundreds of Soviet troops died. Over a hundred thousand Hungarians fled to countries outside the Eastern Bloc. Communists in the Western Bloc disagreed on whether crushing the rebellion was a good idea.

Substitute (association football)

In association football, a substitute is a player who is brought on to the pitch during a match in exchange for a player who is currently playing. Substitutions can be made for many reasons. Sometimes, they are made to replace a player who has become tired or injured. Substitutes can also replace a player who is playing poorly, or can be for tactics. For example, substitute strikers can be brought on for defenders if the team needs to attack. The term "super-sub" refers to a substitution made by the manager that saves the game. This is generally done by scoring one or more late goals. The goals can equalize or win the team the match. Players who have been called "super-subs" include David Fairclough for Liverpool, Adam Le Fondre for Reading, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Javier Hernández for Manchester United, and Edin Džeko for Manchester City among others.

Water-mixable oil paint

Water-mixable oil paint (also called "water soluble" or "water miscible") is a modern type of oil paint.
It is designed to be thinned and cleaned up with water. This avoids using turps (turpentine), whose fumes may be harmful if inhaled, and is a fires risk. 
Water miscible oil paint can be mixed and used with the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint. When it is still wet, it can be removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a solution.
Another advantage of this type of oil paint is that it dries faster than traditional oils (but slower than acrylics). Also, painters can control the speed of drying with supplementary products from artistic paint suppliers.

Turpentine

Turpentine (spirit of turpentine, oil of turpentine, wood turpentine) or turps is a solvent and a source of materials for organic synthesis.
Turpentine is a solvent fluid got by distilling resin from live trees, mainly pines. It is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. As a solvent, turpentine is used for thinning oil-based paints, for producing varnishes, and as a raw material for the chemical industry.
The word "turpentine" comes from the Greek word τερεβινθίνη "terebinthine", the name of a species of tree, the terebinth tree. 
It is hazardous. It is dangerous to inhale, and can cause fires. Because of this, white spirit (mineral turps) or other substitutes are often used.
They are very different chemically.

Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour

Camillo Paolo Filippo Giulio Benso, Count of Cavour, of Isolabella and of Leri (August 10, 1810 – June 6, 1861), better known as Camillo Cavour or simply Cavour, was an Italian politician and statesman. He was an important person in the movement toward the Unification of Italy (Italian: "Risorgimento" 
 
).
Cavour was born in Turin. Until 1831 he worked as a military officer. Later he decided to travel in Europe to learn more about the effects of the industrial revolution. These trips helped him to know and understand the principles of the British Liberal system.
After four years, he returned to Piedmont. He took charge of agriculture and the economy in general. He worked for the spread of schools. During that time, his business and banking activities made him one of the richest men in the Piedmont.
From 1832 to 1848, Cavour was the mayor of Grinzane (now called "Grinzane Cavour" to honor him). In 1847, he founded the newspaper "Il Risorgimento". According to him, the process of economic and social development - that he promoted in the previous years - could be implemented only after a deep restructuring of the political institutions. 
In 1850, Cavour became famous because he advocating the "Siccardi Law" that diminished the privileges of the Catholic clergy. In the same year, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Massimo D'Azeglio, chose him as Minister of Agriculture, Trade and Navy. Later he also became Minister of Finance. After D'Azeglio resigned on November 4, 1852, Cavour became Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia.
Cavour's political program wanted to become the Kingdom of Sardinia a constitutional State based on a moderate and progressive liberalism, so he dedicated himself to a radical renewal of the economy. He modernized and valorized agriculture, strengthened the industrial system and promoted trade with the major European powers. However, his liberal program was criticized by both the "Historical Left" - that cared for the poorest citizens - both the "Historical Right", who considered him as a destroyer of conservative traditions.
In 1858, he signed a treaty of alliance between the Kingdom of Sardinia and the French Empire against the Austrian Empire. In the following year, there was the Second Italian War of Independence. In that war, the Piedmontese and the French defeated the Austrians, who at the time held power in Italy.
After the armistice of Villafranca and Giuseppe Garibaldi's expedition in the South (1860-1861), the unification of Italy was completed. Cavour became the first President of united Italy. He was also the first Minister of Foreign Affairs.. He was the leader of the Liberal parliamentary group. He died of an illness in Turin.

Most are transmitted by a vector, usually by blood-feeding invertebrates. There are different mechanisms among the various species. In an invertebrate host they are generally found in the intestine, but in their mammalian host they usually live in the bloodstream or inside cells.
Trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases, including the fatal human diseases sleeping sickness, caused by "Trypanosoma brucei", and Chagas disease, caused by "Trypanosoma cruzi".
The mitochondrial genome of the "Trypanosoma", and other kinetoplastids, is made of a highly complex series of circles and minicircles. It needs maany proteins for organisation during cell division.

Horse theft

Horse theft is the crime of stealing a horse. A person accused of stealing a horse is known as a horse thief. Horse theft was fairly common throughout the world prior to widespread car ownership. Punishments were often severe for horse theft. In several places the sentence of death was carried out. This was seen as a deterrent against horse theft. Death for an agricultural crime such as horse theft is seen as inhumane under most modern systems of law. Horse theft is an uncommon crime today.

Spur (zoology)

A spur is a bone covered in horn that grows out of an animal's body. While claws or nails grow from the toes, spurs grow on other parts of the foot. These parts are usually connected with joints. Spurs are mostly found on the hindfeet, but some birds have spurs at the edge of their wings.
In mammals.
Not many mammals have spurs.
The male platypus has spurs on the heels of its hind feet. The spurs are hollow and connected to a venom gland. This helps the platypus kick painfully. Echidnas have spurs as well, but they are not venomous. Fossils of some early mammals are found to have spurs also.

Electroreception

Electroreception is the ability animals have to sense electrical sources. It is mostly found in aquatic or amphibious animals. This is because water helps the signals travel better than air. Some exceptions are the echidnas, cockroaches and bees. Electroreception is used in electrolocation.
Research.
Until recently, people thought only vertebrates had electroreception. However, research has shown that bees use electroreception to find flowers. Electroreception is found in lampreys, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, catfishes, gymnotiformes, monotremes, and at least one species of cetacean. Fish have electroreception from their lateral lines. In most groups electroreception is used for predation. The Western long-beaked echidna has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill. Its relative, the duck-billed platypus, has 40,000.
Electrolocation.
Electroreceptive animals use this sense to find where objects are. This is important in ecological niches where the animal cannot see. For example, animals cannot use their vision in caves, in murky water, and at night. Many fish use electric fields to find buried prey. Some shark pups "freeze" when they feel the electric signal of their predators.

Hydrogen ion

Hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. 
Depending on the charge of the ion, there are two types: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions.
Cation (positively charged).
When hydrogen loses its electron, the cations can be formed:
The ions produced by the reaction of these cations with water, as well as their hydrates, are also called 'hydrogen ions'.
In connection with acids, "hydrogen ions" usually refers to hydrons.
Anion (negatively charged).

He was dictator "pro tempore" of Emilia from July 20, 1859 to March 13, 1860. He had the same role in Romagna from November 9, 1859. Farini was appointed President of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of Italy in the December 8, 1862. However, he was struck by a nervous disease that would take him to madness. During the Polish uprising of January 1863, he threatened the King Vittorio Emanuele II with a knife. This was because he wanted to force him to declare war against the Russian Empire. As a result of this act, he was commitmed to the asylu of Novalese, a small town near Turin. Farini died at Genoa in poverty in 1866.

Messier 81

Messier 81 (also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy. It is in the constellation Ursa Major. It is large. It is about 12 million light-years from Earth. It has an active galactic nucleus (which has a supermassive black hole). For these reasons Messier 81 has been well studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is large and very bright. This makes it a popular object for amateur astronomers to look at.
Discovery.
Messier 81 was first discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1774. The galaxy is sometimes called "Bode's Galaxy". In 1779, Pierre Méchain and Charles Messier reidentified Bode's object. They listed it as Messier 81 in the Messier Catalogue.
Dust emission.
Interstellar dust is found in the galaxy's spiral arms. It is connected with star formation areas. The hot blue stars that are found in star formation areas heat the dust. The dust is seen as infrared energy that is sent out from these areas.
Supernova.
Only one supernova has been seen in Messier 81. The supernova is named SN 1993J. It was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garcia in Spain. At the time, it was the second brightest supernova seen in the 20th century.
M81 Group.
Messier 81 is the largest galaxy in the M81 Group. The M81 Group is a group of 34 galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major. This Group and the Local Group, containing the Milky Way, are close together in the Virgo Supercluster. 
Amateur astronomy.
Messier 81 is about 10° northwest of Alpha Ursae Majoris. Messier 81 and Messier 82 can both be easily seen using binoculars and small telescopes.

Planthopper

Planthoppers are insects in the infraorder Fulgoromorpha. They are true bugs (Hemiptera), with over 12,500 described species. 
They are cryptic mimics: their body shape and colours look like leaves and other plant parts in their environment. They either walk very slowly or hop like grasshoppers. 
Members of this group are plant-feeders, and live world-wide. Few are pests, but some are vectors for plant diseases. Phytoplasmas which live in the phloem of plants can be transmitted by planthoppers when feeding.
Their nymphs have a biological gear mechanism at the base of the hind legs, which keeps the legs in synchrony when the insects jump.
In popular culture.

Phytoplasma

Phytoplasmas are a type of parasitic bacteria. They are pathogens of economically important plants, including coconut, sugarcane, and sandalwood.
They are obligate parasites of plant phloem tissue. Their vectors are insects which inject then into the plant cells. They were discovered by scientists in 1967 and were named mycoplasma-like organisms or MLOs. They cannot be grown "in vitro" (in laboratory conditions), and that limits the information about them. They are described by the special term "Candidatus", reserved for such difficult organisms.

Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab

Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab was an organization in Denmark. It was established in 1815 when king Frederick VI of Denmark had been inspired while visiting the Congress of Vienna in Austria The organization was finally disestablished on 28 October 2004 after a meeting inside the Garnison Church in Copenhagen. Queen Marie of Denmark was appointed protector of the organization. That position was then held by someone from the Danish royal family. Queen Marie's birthday was always celebrated as an observance by the organization. They gave awards to domestic workers who had been in long-time service. Most other domestic workers used to leave by the age of 25-30 to form their own family. The organization also ran a schol for housemaid girls. In 1828 they also opened Denmark's first daycare center.
The organization was disestablished as their activity had been outdated. However the housemaid girls at some places had been replaced by modern nanny girls.
When the organization was disestablished, Niels Gustav Bardenfleth published the book "For lang och tro tjeneste. Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab 1815-2004".

Jerry Garcia

Jerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 – August 9, 1995) was an American guitarist and singer-songwriter. He is best known as the founder and longtime lead guitarist (1965-1995) of the band The Grateful Dead. Garcia was seen as an icon of the Hippie counterculture of the 1960s. He was considered an almost mythic hero to his fans, called deadheads. Garcia was an innovator who was constantly experimenting with sound. He was one of the most recorded guitar players of all time. 
Early life.
Jerry Garcia was born August 1, 1942, in San Francisco, California. His father was Jose Ramon Garcia, a Spanish immigrant. His mother, Ruth Marie Clifford, named him after her favorite composer, Jerome Kern. His father was a jazz musician who bought a bar. As a child Garcia took piano lessons. When he was four he lost part of a finger chopping wood. A year later his father drowned. When his mother took over the bar, Garcia went to live with his grandparents. They introduced him to the Grand Ole Opry. This along with his brother's collection of Chuck Berry records gave him an interest in country music. In 1953 his mother remarried and Garcia moved back with her. Garcia attended several different schools in and around San Francisco. But he had little interest in school until 1957 when he attended the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). At age 15 his mother gave him a guitar. In high school he played in several bands. At age 17 he quit school. He joined the Army in 1960 but was given a dishonorable discharge a few months later.
Music career.
Garcia returned to San Francisco. He spent time teaching acoustic guitar and playing bluegrass music. He met up with poet Robert Hunter. Together they started playing in the city's coffeehouses. Hunter later became the lyricist for the Grateful Dead and Garcia's lifelong songwriting partner. Garcia started becoming famous around San Francisco between 1962 and 1964. He was known for his Folk and bluegrass performances. Garcia tried a new drug LSD for the first time in 1964. From that time on he became a lifelong advocate of psychedelic drugs. Musically he began experimenting outside the basic folk music formula and trying out new styles of music. This included jug band, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. A year later they changed their name to the "Warlocks". 
The Warlocks soon became the Grateful Dead. Garcia found the name in a dictionary. While Garcia was the frontman, the band always operated as a leaderless democracy. Garcia continued to experiment musically. He became known for his extended guitar improvisations. He also worked on numerous side projects and frequently sat in with other groups. Jefferson Airplane, in their 1967 album "Surrealistic Pillow", credited him as the group's "spiritual adviser". In 1969, he and John "Marmaduke" Dawson founded the country rock band New Riders of the Purple Sage. The New Riders, or NRPS, became the opening act for the Grateful Dead. At this time Garcia was experimenting with the pedal steel guitar for both NRPS and the Dead.
For the next few years Garcia and the Dead built their reputation based on their live shows. He was a guest performer with other groups. By 1970 the Dead began moving back to their bluegrass, folk and country roots. Garcia began doing solo recordings often accompanied by keyboardist Merl Saunders. In 1973 Garcia was a founding member of the bluegrass supergroup Old and in the Way. Garcia formed the rock band Legion of Mary (band) in 1974. In 1975 he founded the Jerry Garcia Band. It became his most important side project until his death.
By 1974 the Grateful Dead members began to go their own ways. Garcia continued making solo albums and appearances. The Dead begaan touring again in 1976. By the early 1980s Garcia was heavily addicted to drugs. In 1985 Garcia was arrested and sent to a drug treatment center. In 1986, while on tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Bob Dylan, Garcia collapsed. He went into a diabetic coma and was hospitalized. Garcia returned to touring with the Dead. In 1987 the Grateful Dead had their first Top-10 hit, "Touch of Grey".
Death and legacy.
On August 9, 1995, after years of health problems and drug abuse, Jerry Garcia died of heart failure. He was 53 years old. He had checked into a drug treatment center and his body was found during a early morning bed check.

Accipitriformes

Accipitriformes is an order which includes most of the diurnal birds of prey: hawks, eagles, vultures, and many others, about 225 species in all. 
For a long time, the majority view was to include them with the falcons in the Falconiformes. However, a recent DNA study has shown that falcons are not closely related to the Accipitriformes. Instead, they are related to parrots and passerines.
Since then putting the falcons next to the parrots in taxonomic order has been adopted by most ornithologists. The DNA-based proposal includes the New World vultures in the Accipitriformes, but the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) classifies the New World vultures as a separate order, the Cathartiformes.

This phrase is often used to describe a person who temporarily acts in place of an elected or appointed official. Should the official, a mayor for example, be absent or unavailable for any reason, the pro tempore becomes the acting official (acting mayor in this case). The president pro tempore of the United States Senate has been an elected position since 1789. In academic use a professor pro tempore is usually a temporary position. In legal use a judge pro tempore is often an attorney who has been temporarily appointed by a judge. It is also found as a phrase in many kinds of documents to simply mean "for the time being."

Restriction enzyme

A restriction enzyme is an enzyme that cuts DNA at particular places. It works at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as "restriction sites". To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each strand of the DNA double helix.
These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and defend them against invading viruses, which are bacteriophages. 
Inside a prokaryote, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up "foreign" DNA in a process called "restriction". The host DNA is protected by another enzyme which protects the host DNA and blocks cleavage. Together, these two processes are the restriction modification system. It is the earliest and simplest immune system. They are also a kind of selfish, mobile genetic element.
Over 3000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail, and more than 600 of these are available commercially. These enzymes are routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories, and are a vital tool in molecular cloning.
Origins.
Restriction enzymes probably evolved from a common ancestor and became widespread by horizontal gene transfer. In addition, there is growing evidence that restriction endonucleases evolved as a selfish genetic element.

Population control in Singapore

Population control in Singapore had two distinct phases. First, to slow and reverse the boom in births that started after World War II. Second, from the 1980s, to encourage parents to have more children because numbers had fallen below replacement levels. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, The Family Planning and Population Board (FPPB) was set up. At first it favoured small families, and later ran the Stop at Two programme. This pushed for small two-children families and promoted sterilisation. 
As birthrates fell, so the government introduced a policy that encouraged having three or more children.

Selfish DNA

Selfish DNA is a term for sequences of DNA that have two distinct properties: 
In his 1976 book, "The Selfish Gene", Richard Dawkins suggested the idea of selfish DNA when the noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes was discovered. In 1980, two articles in the journal "Nature" expanded and discussed the concept. According to one of these articles:
 The theory of natural selection, in its more general formulation, deals with the competition between replicating entities. It shows that, in such a competition, the more efficient replicators increase in number at the expense of their less efficient competitors. After a sufficient time, only the most efficient replicators survive.
 – L.E. Orgel & F.H.C. Crick
Normal genetically functional DNA might be seen as "replicating entities" that effect their replication by manipulating the cell that they control. In contrast, units of selfish DNA may exploit existing mechanisms in the cell, and multiply without affecting the fitness of the organism in other respects.
There is no sharp boundary between the concepts of selfish DNA and genetically functional DNA. Often it also is difficult to see if a unit of noncoding DNA is functionally important or not; or if important, in what way. What is more, it is not always easy to distinguish between some instances of selfish DNA and some types of viruses.

Bruksvallsloppet is an international cross-country skiing event, held in Bruksvallarna, Sweden over a Saturday-Sunday in November every year. The event acts as FIS World Cup preselection. The competitions are international. During some seasons the event is the final before the World Cup opens. During other seasons, the event instead occurs between World Cupe events. This depends on if the FIS World Cup starts by late October, or if it begins by mid-late November.
In Sweden, the event is generally considered the first major competition of the season.

Marco Minghetti

Marco Minghetti (November 18, 1818 - December 10, 1886) was an Italian economist and statesman.
Biography.
Minghetti was born at Bologna into a family of rich landowners. In March 1848 Pope Pius IX offered to him the post of minister in the first constitutional government of the Papal States. However, on 29 April 1848, after the speech with which Pius IX announced the withdrawal of the papal army from the front of the first italian war of independence, Minghetti resigned.
Member of the "Historical Right", he was Minister of the Interior in the governments led by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and Bettino Ricasoli. He was also Minister of the Treasury in the government led by Luigi Carlo Farini. He was twice Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy: from 24 March 1863 to 28 September 1864 and from from 10 July 1873 to 25 March 1876. 
In 1864 Minghetti signed the "Convention of September" with France: with this document, Italy renounced in Rome and moved the capital from Turin to Florence. There were many protests against this agreement and consequently Minghetti was forced to resign. During his second experience as President, Minghetti raised taxes to achieve a balanced budget. He was able to accomplish this, but there were protests against his tax policy and was forced to resign for the second time. 
Minghetti was the last president of the "Historic Right": after him began the period of the "Historical Left", that remained in power until Francesco Crispi.
He died in Rome.

The star has an estimated average median radius of 1,708 times that of the Sun, or a diameter of 2.4 billion km (1.5 billion mi; 15.9 AU); thus a volume 5 billion times that of the Sun. 
It is about 2.9 kiloparsecs (9,500 light years) from Earth, so it is one of the nearest known hypergiants. If placed at the center of the Solar system, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Jupiter. The radius is not known for certain, and may be larger than the orbit of Saturn.

Alfonso La Marmora

Alfonso La Marmora (18 November 1804 – 5 January 1878), or Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, Alfonso Lamarmora and Alfonso Ferrero, Cavaliere La Marmora, was an Italian general and statesman.
He was born at Turin in a rich and noble family: his father was a Marquis. In 1822 he graduated in the Military Academy of Turin; then began a military career, which led him to become general in 1856. In the Kingdom of Sardinia he was twice Minister of War in the governments led by Massimo D'Azeglio and Camillo Cavour.
In 1854 La Marmora made a law that improved the quality of the troops, created new academies for officers, retouched the recruitment system, bringing to 60,000 Army soldiers (of which only a quarter in active service, while the rest evaded the lever paying a substitute), doubled the units of riflemen and strengthened the light cavalry at the expense of heavy. Even the artillery, health and administrative apparatus were renovated, as well as logistics services.
In 1855 he resigned from the post of Minister of War because he went to fight in the Crimean War. He was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 19 July 1859 to 21 January 1860. In the years immediately after the Italian unification, he was governor of Milan and Prefect of Naples.
Member of the "Historical Right", La Marmora was Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Italy from 18 September 1864 to 20 July 1866. He resigned from office to go fight the third Italian independence war: on this occasion, however, he committed several strategic errors, which cost a heavy defeat for Italy.
In 1870 he retired from political life. He died in Florence and was buried in Biella in the church of San Sebastiano. His brother, Alessandro La Marmora, founded the corps of Bersaglieri.

Luminous blue variable

Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are massive evolved stars. They show unpredictable and sometimes dramatic variations in their spectra and their brightness. They are also known as S Doradus variables after S Doradus, one of the brightest stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud. 
LBVs are extraordinarily rare with just 20 listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as SDor, and some of these are no longer considered to be LBVs.
Discovery and history.
The LBV stars P Cygni and Eta Carinae have been known as unusual variables since the 17th century, but their true nature was not fully understood until much more recently. The term "S Doradus variable" was used to describe them as a group in 1974. AE Andromedae is one of the most luminous blue variables in the Andromeda galaxy, M31.

Pistol star

The Pistol star is a blue hypergiant. It is one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way galaxy.
It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the central region of our galaxy. It is about 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star, if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light.
Properties.
The Pistol star was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in the early 1990s.
The star may have ejected almost 10 solar masses of material in giant outbursts perhaps 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. Its stellar wind is over 10 billion times stronger than the Sun's. The star's exact age and future are not known, but it is expected to end in a brilliant supernova or hypernova in 1 to 3 million years. Its mass is equally uncertain, probably around 200 times the sun when first formed. Now it is much less because it has lost so much mass.
Early reports suggested that it might be the most luminous star known, being almost 100 million times as luminous as the Sun.
Later studies, however, have reduced its estimated luminosity. It is now regarded as a candidate luminous blue variable about one-third as luminous as the binary star system Eta Carinae. Even so, it radiates about as much energy in 20 seconds as does the Sun in a year.
A close point source has been discovered hidden in the surrounding nebulosity, but it is not known whether it is a star or even whether it is physically associated.

Noctiluca

Noctiluca, usually "Noctiluca scintillans", is the sea sparkle. It is a free-living marine-dwelling species of dinoflagellate. 
It shows bioluminescence when disturbed: this produces a "milky seas effect". The bioluminescence is produced in the cytoplasm of this single-celled protist. It is done by a luciferin-luciferase reaction in thousands of spherical organelles, called scintillons. Nonluminescent populations in the genus "Noctiluca" lack these scintillons.
"Noctiluca" is a heterotroph (non-photosynthetic) that engulfs by phagocytosis. They eat plankton, diatoms, other dinoflagellates, fish eggs and bacteria. The diatom "Thalassiosira" is known as a favourite food source of "Noctiluca".
"N. scintillans" also takes in tiny phytoplankton which live as endosymbionts. They do photosynthesis for their larger host. Diatoms are often found in the vacuoles (internal membrane-bound storage compartments) of "Noctiluca". The green non-feeding symbionts can grow photoautotrophically for generations.

Maluridae

Maluridae is a family of small, insectivorous passerine birds endemic to Australia and New Guinea. 
Commonly known as 'wrens', they are unrelated to the true wrens of the Northern Hemisphere. The family includes 14 species of fairywren, 3 emu-wrens, and 10 grasswrens.
The Maluridae are one of the many bird families to have evolved from a great adaptive radiation of what were crows to new ecological opportunities in Australasia. Their closest relatives are the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae. 
Their obvious similarity to the wrens of Europe and America is not genetic, but simply the consequence of convergent evolution between more-or-less unrelated species that share the same ecological niche.
Their behaviour is similar to many other passerine families. The males defend territory and attract females by song and bright coloured plumage. Females are a dowdy brownish colour, better for camouflage. The males' colour is much less bright out of season. They are insectivorous, and nest in dense undergrowth. The parallels with Eurasian wrens are quite striking.

Seleucus I Nicator

Seleucus I Nicator ("Seleucus the Victor") (c. 358 BC – 281 BC) was one of the generals friends of Alexander who were given, or took control of, his empire. Having served as an infantry general under Alexander, he eventually took the title of basileus (~"king"). He set up the Seleucid Empire over much of the territory in the Near East which Alexander had conquered.
After the death of Alexander in June 323 BC, Seleucus initially supported Perdiccas, the regent of Alexander's empire, and was made Commander of the Companions (the elite cavalry of Alexander) at the Partition of Babylon in 323 BC. 
The 'Wars of the Diadochi' in 322 were the wars of Alexander's successors. Perdiccas failed against Ptolemy in Egypt, which led to the mutiny of his troops. Perdiccas was betrayed and assassinated in a conspiracy by Seleucus and others sometime in either 321 or 320 BC.
In 321 BC, Seleucus was appointed Satrap of Babylon under the new regent Antipater. Almost immediately, the wars between the Diadochi resumed and Antigonus forced Seleucus to flee Babylon. Seleucus was only able to return to Babylon in 312 BC with the support of Ptolemy. 
From 312 BC, Seleucus ruthlessly expanded his dominions and eventually conquered the Persian and Median lands. Seleucus ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire enormous eastern part of Alexander's empire:
 Appian—The Syrian Wars
Seleucus' wars took him as far as India, where, after two years of war (305-303 BC), he made peace with the Indian Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. Seleucus exchanged his eastern satrapies in the Indus River Valley for 500 war elephants. These would play a decisive role against Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and against Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC.
Seleucus' victories against Antigonus and Lysimachus left the Seleucid dynasty virtually unopposed in Asia and in Anatolia. However, Seleucus also hoped to take control of Lysimachus' European territories, primarily Thrace and Macedon itself. But upon arriving in Thrace in 281 BC, Seleucus was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court with his sister Lysandra. The assassination of Seleucus destroyed Seleucid prospects in Thrace and Macedon, and paved the way for Ptolemy Ceraunus to absorb much of Lysimachus' former power in Macedon. Seleucus was succeeded by his son Antiochus I as ruler of the Seleucid Empire.
Seleucus founded a number of new cities during his reign, including Antioch (300 BC) and in particular Seleucia on the Tigris (ca. 305 BC), the new capital of the Seleucid Empire, a foundation that eventually depopulated Babylon.

Abscess

An abscess (Latin: "abscessus" 
 
) is pus that has built up within the tissue of the body. Signs and symptoms of abscesses include: redness, pain, warmth, and swelling. This swelling feels like it is filled with fluid if it is pressed. The area of redness is often bigger than the area of swelling. Carbuncles are an abscess in the hair follicles.
An abscess is usually caused by a bacterial infection. Often many different types of bacteria can be part of a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is MRSA (methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus"). Rarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is proved by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.
Treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is to cut it open and drain out the pus. Antibiotics are usually not needed for healthy people. New studies have found that it is better to close the wound after draining, instead of packing it with gauze. This can speed healing and not increase risk of the abscess returning. Sometimes simply sucking out the pus with a needle is not enough.
Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years. As many as 65% of people who take intravenous drugs get abscesses In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess. In Australia around 13,000 people were put in hospital in 2008 for the disease.
Signs and symptoms.
Abscesses can form in any kind of solid tissue. They are usually on the skin surface (such as a boils, or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, brain, teeth, kidneys and tonsils. The condition can become more complicated if the pus and the infection spread to other parts of the body. This can lead to gangrene, where areas of body tissue die.
The main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills.
Internal abscesses are more difficult to find. The abscess can be painful, and a person will have a high temperature, and generally feel unwell.
Internal abscesses do not usually heal without medical treatment. In some cases an abscess could even cause death, for example where an abscess in the neck put pressure on the trachea.
If abscess is on the surface, it may be "fluctuant", that is it feels like it is full of fluid, when touched. This is a wave-like motion caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess.
Causes.
Abscesses are caused by bacterial infection, parasites, or foreign substances.
Bacterial infection is the most common cause. Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is MRSA. Among spinal subdural abscesses, methicillin-sensitive "Staphylococcus aureus" is the most common organism involved.
Rarely parasites can causes abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. Specific parasites known to do this include: dracunculiasis and myiasis.

<doc id="479519" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=479519" title="Dictyostelid">
Dictyostelid

The dictyostelids are a group of cellular slime molds, or "social amoebae". They are very unusual eukaryote organisms. For much of their life they live as separate cells. Then in hard times they come together to reproduce as a fruiting body. The fruiting body produces spores with protective walls. They survive and open up in better times. So these organisms are both unicellular and multicellular.
As separate amoebae, they feed and divide normally. They mostly eat soil bacteria. When the food supply runs out, they come together to form a kind of slug-like thing. The slug has a definite front and rear. It responds to light and temperature differences, and has the ability to move. Under the right conditions the slug becomes a sporocarp (fruiting body). A stalk holds up one or more balls of spores. These spores are inactive cells protected by tough cell walls. They become new amoebae once food is available.
"Dictyostelium" has been used as a model organism in molecular biology and genetics. It is studied as an example of cell communication, differentiation, and programmed cell death. Research on "Dictyostelium" is available on-line at dictyBase. 
Aggregation in "Dictyostelium".
The aggregation of the amoebae relies on a signal molecule. One cell, the founder of the colony, begins to secrete the signal in response to stress. Others detect the signal, and respond in two ways:
The effect of this is to relay the signal through the nearby population of amoebae. They move to the area of highest signal concentration.
Genome.
The entire genome of "Dictyostelium discoideum" was published in "Nature" in 2005. The haploid genome contains about 12,500 genes on six chromosomes. For comparison, the diploid human genome has 20,000–25,000 genes (represented twice) on 23 chromosome pairs.
Sexual reproduction.
Sexual development can occur when amoeboid cells are starved of their bacterial food supply and in the dark.
Mating starts by gametogenesis. This produces small, mobile gametes that fuse to form a small binucleate cell. The volume of the binucleate cell then increases to produce a giant binuclear cell. As growth proceeds, the nuclei swell, and then fuse forming a true diploid zygote giant cell. As this is occurring, amoebae undergo chemotaxis towards the giant cell surface. The zygote giant cell ingests the surrounding amoebae, and digests them. Next the zygote forms a macrocyst which stays dormant for a time before germination occurs. When the macrocyst germinates it releases many haploid amoeboid cells.
Classification.
First discovered in a North Carolina forest in 1935, "Dictyostelium discoideum" was at first classified under 'lower fungi.' and later in the kingdoms Protista and Fungi. By the 1990s, most scientists accepted the present classification.
Amoebozoa are now regarded as a separate kingdom-level clade, being more closely related to both animals and fungi than to plants.
Model host organism for "Legionella".
"Dictyostelium" shares many molecular features with macrophages. Macrophages are the human host of "Legionella". The cytoskeletal composition of "D. discoideum" is similar to that of mammalian cells. So are the processes driven by these components, such as phagocytosis, membrane trafficking, endocytic transit and vesicle sorting. Like leukocytes, "D. discoideum" have chemotaxis. Hence, "D. discoideum" is a suitable model system to see the influence of host cell factors during "Legionella" infections.

Full-size vehicle

A full-size car is a marketing term used in North America for an automobile larger than a mid-size car. Traditional U.S. full-size passenger cars were designed to be comfortable for six occupants and their luggage for long-distance driving. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently uses the term "large car" to mean full-size cars based on their combined interior passenger and luggage volume. A full-size SUV (or CUV), is a utility vehicle that has over 100 cuft of cargo volume. This is measured when the rear seats are folded or removed for more cargo capacity. Both full-size and mid-size SUVs and CUVs have three rows of seating (8 or 9 passengers). A full size van is a marketing term used for a van larger than a minivan. Seating is one difference. A full-size van may be equipped to seat up to 15 passengers. A minivan often seats up to 8.

Legionella

The genus Legionella is a pathogenic group of Gram-negative bacteria. It includes the species causing a pneumonia-type illness called Legionnaires' disease, and a mild flu-like illness called Pontiac fever.
It may be seen with a silver stain. "Legionella" is common in many environments, including soil and aquatic systems, with at least 50 species and 70 strains identified.
The side-chains of the cell wall carry the bases responsible for the somatic antigen specificity of these organisms. The chemical composition of these side chains both with respect to components as well as arrangement of the different sugars determines the nature of the somatic or O antigen determinants, which are essential means of serologically classifying many Gram-negative bacteria.
"Legionella" got its name after a 1976 outbreak of a then-unknown "mystery disease" sickened. 221 people were infected, with 34 deaths. The outbreak was first noticed among people attending a convention of the American Legion—an association of U.S. military veterans.
On January 18, 1977, the cause was identified as a previously unknown bacterium later named "Legionella".

Frame (vehicle)

A vehicle frame, is the main structural element of a motor vehicle. All other components are connected to the frame. Another term for this design is "body-on-frame" construction. A vehicle's frame is part of the chassis.
The first motor vehicles were almost all built on a frame. Since then, nearly all cars have changed to unibody construction (see below). The last UK mass-produced car with a chassis was the Triumph Herald, which was discontinued in 1971. By contrast, today nearly all trucks and buses still use chassis frames.
Types.
Ladder Frame.
Named because it resembles a ladder, the ladder frame is the simplest and oldest of all designs. It has two rails, or beams, and crossmembers connecting them. Most manufacturers stopped using them on cars around the 1940s. They are now seen mainly on trucks.
Unibody.
In a unibody (also unit body) design, the sheet metal of the body is also the frame. It may use subframes in certain areas. Unibody designs first appeared in the 1930s on some Citroën automobiles. Many modern vehicles use unibody construction including cars, minivans and crossovers. A few SUVs use unibody construction. An example is the Dodge Durango.

Pedal steel guitar

The pedal steel guitar is a type of electric steel guitar that is built on legs or a stand. It usually has foot pedals which adjust the sound of the instrument. Like other electric guitars, the musical instrument produces sound by the vibration of its strings which are converted by magnetic pickup connected to an amplifier.
Pedal steels may have one or two "necks" that typically have 10 strings each. Some may have as many as 14. Unlike most other guitars, pedal steel guitars have reference lines on the fretboard. This is where frets would be, but there are no actual frets. The player changes the pitch of one or more strings by sliding a steel from one position to another while plucking the strings. Pedal steels are typically plucked with a thumb pick and fingers, or two or three fingerpicks. The pedals are mounted on a cross bar below the body. The action of the pedals may be fixed or changed by the player to select which strings the pedals affects. While there are some fairly standard pedal assignments, many advanced players devise their own setups, called "copedents". The pedal steel evolved from the console steel guitar and lap steel guitar. 
The pedal steel, with its smooth "portamenti", bending chords and complex riffs, is one of the most easily recognized instruments of American country music.

Duck family (Disney)

The Duck family is a fictional family of cartoon ducks. They are related to Disney character Donald Duck.
Ancestors.
In the comic story "The Family Tree Spree" (1962), Donald discovers that he has only two notable ancestors. One is Columbust Duck, who tried to prove the Flat Earth model. The other is Deadeye Dick, a stagecoach robber. If Columbust lived at the same time as Christopher Columbus, he would be Donald's oldest known relative on his father's side. On his mother's side, Donald's earliest known relative lived in the second millennium BC.
Pintail Duck was a 16th-century Duck relative. He was the first early ancestor to appear in person.
Asa Duck was the great-great-great uncle of Grandma Duck.
First generation.
Humperdink Duck is the earliest known modern Duck family member. He is the husband of Elvira Coot, known as "Grandma Duck". He is Donald's grandfather.
Elvira "Grandma" Duck (née Coot) is Donald's grandmother. She is the Duck family matriarch. In most stories, she is called "Grandma Duck".
Second generation.
Quackmore Duck (born 1875) is the father of Donald Duck. His parents are Humperdink and Elvira "Grandma" Duck.
Hortense Duck (née McDuck; born 1876) is the wife of Quackmore Duck and Donald's mother. She was born in Scotland and is the youngest sister of Scrooge McDuck.
Daphne Gander (née Duck) is Donald's aunt. She is the mother of Gladstone Gander.
Eider Duck is Donald's uncle.
Lulubelle Duck (née Loon) is the wife of Eider Duck. She is the mother of Abner and Fethry Duck.
Upsy Duck is Donald's uncle from the 1965 story "Mastering The Matterhorn", illustrated by Tony Strobl.
Sheriff Dan Duck (aka Cousin Dan) is an old cousin of Donald. He is the sheriff of a Western town called "Bent Spur Gulch".
Third generation.
Donald Duck (born 1920) is the most well-known member of the family. He is the son of Quackmore and Hortense Duck. His girlfriend is Daisy Duck.
Thelma "Della" Duck is the mother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
Fethry Duck was Donald's cousin.
Whitewater Duck was only in the story "Log Jockey", published in "Walt Disney's Comics and Stories" #267 on December, 1962. According to that story, he is a distant cousin of Donald, and works as a lumberjack in the woods.
Dudly D. Duck is a cousin of Donald. He appears in the comic story "Why All the Crabby Ducks?".
Nancy Duck is a female cousin of Donald.
Fourth generation.
Huebert "Huey", Deuteronomy "Dewey", and Louis "Louie" Duck are Donald's three nephews. They are the identical triplet sons of Della Duck and an unnamed father.
Dugan Duck is Fethry Duck's nephew.
Coot kin.
The Coot family (usually called the Coot Kin in stories) are the relatives of Grandma Duck. They and the Clan McDuck make up the third major branch of Donald's family tree. The name "Coot" was used by several comic authors including Carl Barks. Don Rosa was the first to show their relationship to Donald. The members of the family are shown as white Pekin ducks like Donald, although real-life coots are typically black.
Cornelius Coot (1790–1880) founded Duckburg.
Clinton Coot (1830-1910) was first mentioned in "Uncle Scrooge Adventures" #27 in the story "Guardians of the Lost Library", first published in July 1994. There he was introduced as the son of Cornelius Coot and the founder of The Junior Woodchucks.
Gertrude Coot (née Gadwall) is the wife of Clinton Coot. She is the mother of Casey and Elvira Coot ("Grandma Duck").
Casey Coot (1860-c. 1960) first appeared in "Last Sled to Dawson", first published in June, 1988. He is an unsuccessful gold prospector. He was a friend of Scrooge McDuck during his years in the Klondike.
Gretchen Coot (née Grebe) is the wife of Casey Coot. She is the mother of Cuthbert and Fanny Coot.
Fanny Coot is the mother of Donald's cousin Gus Goose.
Cuthbert Coot was introduced in the story "Webfooted Wrangler," first published in April 1945. He is a distant cousin of Donald Duck. He is a rancher.
Kildare Coot was introduced by artist Romano Scarpa. He is a very eccentric fourth cousin of Donald Duck.
Goose family.
Luke Goose (sometimes called Luke the Goose) is the father of Donald's cousin Gus Goose.
Gus Goose is Donald Duck's second cousin. He is the great-nephew of Grandma Duck. Gus eats a lot. His first appearance was in the 1939 animated short "Donald's Cousin Gus".
Gander family.
Goostave Gander is Gladstone Gander's father. In some early stories he is married to Matilda McDuck, Scrooge's sister. Carl Barks later had him married to Daphne Duck instead.
Gladstone Gander is Donald's cousin. He is the son of Goosetave and Daphne Gander.
Shamrock Gander is Gladstone's nephew.
Clyde is another nephew of Gladstone's.
Characters surnamed "Duck" of uncertain relationship.
This section contains a list of characters with the surname "Duck" who may or may not be related to Donald. As Don Rosa explained, "Duck" is an understandably common name in Duckburg (just as "Smith" or "Jones" are common in the real-life United States) and does not necessarily identify a blood relation of Donald.
0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier are a secret-agent duo.
April, May, and June Duck are the triplet nieces of Daisy Duck.
Belle Duck is a plus-sized, tall and elegant duck lady.
Daisy Duck is Donald's girlfriend. Huey, Dewey, and Louie sometimes call her "Aunt Daisy". It is unclear if she is their real aunt.
Darkwing Duck is the protagonist of a TV series named after him. He is most likely not related to Donald because "Darkwing Duck" is the character's superhero identity. His name in private life is Drake Mallard.
Dexter Duck, like Gladstone Gander, conpetes with Donald Duck to get Daisy Duck's attention.
Dickie Duck (Italian: "Paperetta Yè-Yè" 
 
) was introduced as Goldie O'Gilt's granddaughter. But in the story "Paperetta e la leggenda del luna park" by Romano Scarpa she calls Huey, Dewey and Louie "cuginetti" (small/young cousins) and then "cugini" (cousins). This might mean that she and Donald's nephews share the same surname in English language because of a kinship.
Dimwitty Duck originally appears as an assistant of Donald Duck.
Hustler Duck is an obscure character that works as a marketing man.
Moby Duck appears to be a relative of Donald's. Their relationship is never specifically described. His name is a spoof of "Moby-Dick".
The identity of Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father is something of a mystery. The character does not appear in any stories.

Tetraplegia

Tetraplegia (or quadriplegia) is a condition in which a human loses use of all limbs and the torso. It usually affects both the ability to move and the use of the senses.
"Quadriplegia" is the common term in North America. "Tetraplegia" is the term in Europe.
Tetraplegia is caused by damage either to the brain or to the spinal cord at the level of the cervical vertebrae. People with an injury at the C1 vertebra may lose functions from the neck down. They may need a machine to breathe for them. People with injuries at the C7 vertebra may still be able to use their arms and hands.

An Old Town of a city or town is its historic center or district. It is often the older town the newer parts were built around. It may also be an area built to resemble the older original town. Old towns usually have historical and architectural value that make them worth restoring. In Europe old towns are usually the medieval towns or villages that the newer city was built up around. Old towns may have cobblestone streets, old churches, and balconies hanging over narrow back streets. Because they are restrictive traffic traps many old town districts do not allow motor vehicles.

The group made twenty-four studio albums. Wilson made one solo album, "Pacific Ocean Blue". It stayed popular with critics over the years.
Dennis was born in Inglewood, California. He was the only surfer of the group and he lived the beach lifestyle that the Beach Boys wrote about in their songs.
Meeting Charles Manson.
In 1968, Dennis Wilson met a musician, Charles Manson, who had a group of followers in a religious cult. His cult members were called "The Family". Wilson became very fond of Manson and his friends. They all moved into his home on Sunset Boulevard in west Los Angeles for a few months. 
At first, Wilson was writing some songs with Manson, who could play a guitar. Thinking he had talent, he introduced him to a few friends in the music business, including Terry Melcher, (the son of Doris Day). But he soon became afraid of Manson's bad temper and violent behavior. So finally Wilson escaped by just moving out of his house and leaving Manson there. 
Manson was actually a dangerous and mentally ill criminal. In 1969, with the help of "The Family", he murdered at least eight famous people in California.
Death.
On December 28, 1983, while partying soon after his 39th birthday, Wilson drowned at Marina del Rey in Los Angeles. He had been drinking alcohol all day and diving into the sea in the afternoon. He was buried at sea off the California coast by the U.S. Coast Guard on January 4, 1984. President Ronald Reagan allowed the burial.

Combination (mathematics)

In mathematics, combination is used for picking a number of objects from a given set of objects. Combinatorics looks at the number of possibilities to pick k objects from a set of n. It does not take into account the order, in which these are picked. People talk about finding permutations, if the order in which the objects are picked matters. It is easy to see that there are more permutations than combinations. One combination, picking the objects 1,3, and 5 in the example can be done in the following ways: {1,3,5}, {1,5,3}, {3,1,5},{3,5,1}, {5,3,1}, {5,1,3} and {5,3,1}.

Izumo no Okuni

Izumo no Okuni was a Japanese woman from the warring states period (15th to 16th century) who began the Japanese entertainment called kabuki. Her name means "Okuni from Izumo". Her performing arts evolved from traditional dancing. Okuni founded kabuki.
Birth.
She is from Izumo Taisha shrine in the late 16th century. She was a daughter of Sanemon Nakamura but it is not sure when she was born and died.
Her early dancing.
She started to dance Kagura-mai and Nenbutsu-odori (two traditional dances) in kimono in order to gather money for repairing Izumo Taisha. Although dance was holy at that time, Okuni went on stage in the highest fashion. She inserted a song and character of ghost on stage. It became popular because it was unique.
Origin of kabuki.
At first Okuni danced simple dances. Later, she danced with clothing of a man, and showed at the Kitano Tenmangutemple in 1603. This became the first kabuki. 
Okuni's troupe was exclusively female. Thus, she required her actresses to play both male and female roles. In particular, Okuni herself was best known for her roles as samurai and Christian priests. As her group gained fame, she was copied by many others, particularly brothels. They offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients, and get prostitutes who had marketable acting and singing skills. This new style of exclusively female groups became known as shibai, onnakabuki, (from onna, the Japanese word for "woman" or "girl") and Okuni kabuki.
In 1629, due to public outcry for moral reform, those under the shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu forbade women from performing in kabuki.

Shark fin soup

Shark fin soup (or shark's fin soup) is a popular soup in Chinese cuisine. It is usually served at special occasions such as weddings and banquets. The shark fins provide texture, while the taste comes from the other soup ingredients. The soup was first mentioned centuries ago as a favorite of Chinese Emperors. It costs up to $100 a bowl. But it has a much higher environmental cost. About 70 million sharks a year are killed for their fins. Currently about 25% of sharks are threatened species.

Toronto streetcar system

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
The Toronto streetcar system is a network of eleven streetcar routes in the Canadian city of Toronto, Ontario. It is by far the largest network of its kind in the Americas. It operates as part of the Toronto Transit Commission's public transport network, and shares a common fare system with buses and subway services.
Unlike modern light rail systems that are becoming more commonplace in North America, streetcars runs on city streets and call at frequent bus-type stops, where the passenger waits on the sidewalk for the next streetcar and pays his or her fare on board the vehicle. There are 685 of these stops, eight of which are shared with and connect to the subway system. The system mainly serves the downtown and waterfront areas of the city, and acts as feeder routes to the subway.
The system, which has been one of the longest in continuous operation, was opened in 1861 and was electrified in 1892. Vehicles run on 82 km of tracks with a non-standard gauge of 1,495 mm (4 ft 10+ in) and collect power from overhead lines at 600 V DC using trolley poles mounted on each streetcar.
More than 300,000 people ride the system on an average weekday, and about 100 million on an annual basis, making it among the busiest systems in the world.

Josephoartigasia

Josephoartigasia is an extinct genus of giant rodent from the Pliocene. It is related to the living pacarana. The genus includes the largest known rodent, "Josephoartigasia monesi". 
The two species would have looked like gigantic pacarana, or capybaras the size of cows. However, Dr Virginie Millien, from McGill University in Montreal, said the mathematical models originally used to calculate the rodent's mass from its skull probably overestimated its body size.
A recent report said it had big front teeth, which it might have used for defence.

Game bird

Game birds are wild birds which are hunted, killed and eaten by humans. It is a sport, and a way of getting food. It happens in most countries, but the details vary. Usually there are laws which govern the hunting. Usually, guns are used, and so there are gun laws. Also, regulations protect the birds' breeding season, so that another generation of birds will grow to replace the present generation.
Although the birds are wild, most of them are "managed" if they live on estates. Of course, birds which migrate cannot be managed in the same way. Shooting game birds on Scottish estates is for them a major source of income. The managing consists of making sure there are enough birds for the next shooting season. 
In the UK game is defined in law by the Game Act 1831. It is illegal to shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other (non-game birds) that are hunted for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Forestry Commission have a big say in how the hunting is regulated.
UK law defines game as including:

Royal Society for the Protection of Birds

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is an organisation registered in Great Britain as a charity. It was founded as the Plumage League in 1889 by Emily Williamson. 
The RSPB works to promote conservation and protection of birds and the wider environment. It runs public awareness campaigns and petitions, and it operates nature reserves throughout the United Kingdom.
The RSPB has 2,000 employees, 17,600 volunteers and more than a million members (including 150,000 youth members). It is the largest wildlife conservation charity in Europe. The RSPB has many local groups and maintains 200 nature reserves.
The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB.
The original members of the RSPB were all women. They campaigned against the fashion of wearing exotic feathers in hats. To this end the Society had two simple rules:
At the time of founding, the trade in plumage for use in hats was very large: in the first quarter of 1884, almost 7,000 bird-of-paradise skins were being imported to Britain, along with 0.4 million birds from the West Indies and Brazil, and 0.36 million birds from British India.
The Society attracted support from some women of high social standing who belonged to the social classes that popularised the wearing of feathered hats, including the Duchess of Portland (who became the Society's first President) and the Ranee of Sarawak. The organisation began to attract the support of many other influential figures, both male and female, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. The society received a Royal Charter in 1904 from Edward VII. It petitioned Parliament to introduce laws banning the use of plumage in clothing.

John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts

"Kennedy Center" redirects here. For the spaceport, see Kennedy Space Center.
The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (commonly called the Kennedy Center) is a performing arts center in Washington, D.C. The Center opened on September 8, 1971. It shows theater, dance, ballet, orchestral, chamber, jazz, popular, and folk music performances.
It is the busiest performing arts center in the United States. Each year, it hosts about 2,000 performances, and almost two million people watch one of these performances. The Center presents music, dance, and theater to the public; helps artists make new work;s and does arts education.
The "National Cultural Center Act" of Congress in 1958 requires that its programming must be paid for through private money. The center is a public-private partnership. It mostly gets its money from ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations, and private foundations. It also gets federal funding each year to pay for the maintenance and operation of the building. It is both the nation's public memorial to President John F. Kennedy and the "national center for the performing arts."
The building was designed by architect Edward Durell Stone, built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain, and is administered by a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution.
History.
In 1933, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt first had the idea for the center. It was during the Great Depression, and she thought the government should provide jobs for unemployed actors. In 1935 and 1938, the United States Congress talked about making a building for it in Washington D.C., but the only thing they did was add a small auditorium to the Library of Congress.
In 1950, Representative Arthur George Klein proposed a bill to build a cultural center. Congress debated the bill between 1955 and 1958. The bill was passed in summer 1958 and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law on September 4, 1958.
This was the first time that the federal government provided money for a structure dedicated to the performing arts. It cost a total of $70 million to build it. Congress gave most of the money, but donations from foundations, individuals, and businesses were also given.
Construction and Opening.
Edward Durell Stone was chosen as the architect.
Construction of the building began on December 11, 1965.
The first performance was September 5, 1971, with a premiere of Leonard Bernstein's "Mass" in the Opera House. The Center officially opened on September 8, 1971, with a formal gala and premiere performance of the Bernstein "Mass". The Concert Hall was first used on September 9, 1971, and the Eisenhower Theater was first used on October 18, 1971.
It was first called The National Cultural Center, but it was renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1964, to honor John F. Kennedy after his assassination.
Changes (1990-2005).
By 1990, the Kennedy Center facility was in bad condition. In 1991 and 1992, Congress recommended that $27.7 million be spent to restore the center and improve handicapped access. There were more improvements between 1995 and 2005.
Kennedy Center Honors.
 relarticle mainpage">Main : Kennedy Center Honors
Each year since 1978, the Kennedy Center Honors have been awarded by the Center's Board of Trustees. Each year, five artists or groups are honored for the contributions that they have made throughout their life to American culture and the performing arts. They are awarded to people in dance, music, theater, opera, film, and television. The Center has awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor since 1998.
Department of VSA and Accessibility.
The Department of VSA (Very Special Arts) and Accessibility (formerly VSA Arts) is an international nonprofit organization. It was started in 1974 by Ambassadress Jean Kennedy Smith. It helps people with disabilities learn through, participate in, and enjoy the arts. VSA provides educators, parents, and artists with resources to support arts programming in schools and communities. VSA also shows the works of artists with disabilities. Affiliated with the Kennedy Center since 2005, VSA was official merged into the organization in 2011 to become part of the Center's Department of VSA and Accessibility.
Management.
Before 1980, the board of directors and its chairman were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the center. Other parts of the center's programming and operations were overseen by other people.
Currently, the artistic director is in charge of artistic programming, the center's president is in charge of the center's day-to-day operations, and The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees is in charge of the building.

Jeff Smith

Jeffrey L. "Jeff" Smith (January 22, 1939 – July 7, 2004) was an American chef. He wrote several best-selling cookbooks. Smith was the host of "The Frugal Gourmet", a long running American cooking show. He was called "the most visible gourmet" of the 1980s by Time Magazine.
Career.
Smith was born in Seattle, Washington on January 22, 1939. He attended the University of Puget Sound in 1962. In 1965, Smith graduated from Drew University. He was ordained a minister in the United Methodist church. Smith returned to the University of Puget Sound as the chaplain of Aldergate Methodist Church in 1966. In 1972, he left the university to open his own restaurant called the Chaplain's Pantry. In 1973, Smith began his first cooking show, "Cooking Fish Creatively", on a local Tacoma, Washington PBS station, KTPS-TV. After several seasons it was renamed "The Frugal Gourmet". The name was suggested by his wife, Patty. Known himself as "The Frugal Gourmet", Smith's nickname quickly became "The Frug". Smith always appeared wearing his "trademark" blue and white striped apron. His first cookbook, "Recipes from The Frugal Gourmet", was published in 1977. The theme music for "The Frugal Gourmet" was the Bourree movement from "Water Music" by George Frideric Handel.
In 1981, Smith had heart valve surgery. He was forced to sell the Chaplain's Pantry to pay the huge medical costs. In 1983, he was interviewed on the Phil Donahue show promoting his paperback cookbook. After that, Smith sold 45,000 copies at $4.75 each. The profits allowed him to get out of debt. In 1983, PBS station WTTW in Chicago picked up his show and aired it nationally. The show aired for over 200 episode. Smith ended every episode of "The Frugal Gourmet" by saying, "Until I see you again, this is the Frugal Gourmet. I bid you peace, bye-bye". Smith was also quoted as saying "frugal does not mean cheap." He explained, "A frugal gourmet is a thrifty person who enjoys good food."
Smith appeared in television commercials for Columbia Crest Wines. In 1995, Smith hosted "The Frugal Gourmet Keeps the Feast" for the Odyssey Television Network. That same year, he acted in the movie "Grumpier Old Men".
Scandal.
In 1997, seven men filed lawsuits against him for alleged sexual abuse. Six of the men said they were abused when they were younger and worked at the Chaplain's Pantry. The case never went to court. Smith said the abuse never happened. The "Frugal Gourmet" empire ended with the scandal.
Personal life.
Smith married his wife Patricia in 1966. They had two sons, Channing and Jason. Patricia is credited by originating the nickname "Frugal Gourmet".
Death.
Smith died in his sleep on July 7, 2004 at the age of 65. He had suffered from heart disease for a long time. Smith was survived by his wife Patricia, and sons Channing and Jason, as well as daughters-in-law Yuki and Lisa.

Public interest

Public interest is a term meaning something that benefits all the people. This is compared to a personal interest that only benefits one person. Something that is in the public interest is something that concerns the general public. It is something governments recognize, protect and serve. Thomas Aquinas stated the purpose of government and the law was to serve the “common good” (Latin: "bonum commune" 
 
), meaning the public interest. The term can also be vague in its use. For example, 'public interest' can be used by governments for the purpose of state secrecy. It can also be misused to mean something that actually serves private interests.

Acacia cyclops

The red-eyed wattle or western coastal wattle ("Acacia cyclops") is an Australian tree. It is in the plant family Fabaceae. It is one of nearly 1000 species of "Acacia" in Australia. It is found along the west coast of Western Australia as far north as Jurien Bay, and along the south coast into South Australia. 
Almost all wattles have cream to golden colored flowers. The small flowers are arranged in round groups. Only the male part of the flower sticks out.
Red-eyed wattle can be used to help stabilise coastal sands. It was introduced into Africa for this purpose, but it has spread fast and is now a serious pest in South Africa, where it is known as 'rooikrans' (= 'red garland' in Afrikaans).
The green seed pods may be used as a natural soap, by crushing them and using the pods with water to wash with.

House of Este

The 'House of Este is a European princely dynasty. It is split into two branches. The elder branch known as the "House of Welf-Este" or "House of Welf" (Guelf or Guelph). The younger branch is known as the "House of Fulc-Este" or later simply as the "House of Este".
The elder branch of the House of Este included the dukes of Brunswick and Lüneburg (1208–1918). It also produced Britain's Hanoverian monarchs and one Emperor of Russia (Ivan VI). The younger branch of the House of Este included the Sovereign Dukes of Ferrara (1240–1597), and Modena and Reggio (1288–1796). Following the marriage of Maria Beatrice d'Este to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria (1771) the House of Austria-Este was formed. 
The House of Este has a long history. The earliest known ancestor is Albert of Este, who died in 938. He was the Count of Este and Marquis of Tuscany. His great-grandson Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan is considered the founder of of the House of Este.

Flatiron Building

The Flatiron Building, originally called the Fuller Building, is at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City.
It is a groundbreaking skyscraper. When finished, in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city. The building sits on a triangular island-block. Whereas most Manhattan streets run either N/S or E/W, Broadway is an exception. It runs from the N/W to the S/E. As it does so, it cuts across Fifth Avenue, a large and important road running N/S. At the junction sits the Flatiron on a triangle of land. There are also two E/W roads, a main road, 23rd St. and a minor road, East 22 St.
The name "Flatiron" is because it looks like a old-fashioned cast iron clothes iron. The building has been called "[o]ne of the world's most iconic skyscrapers, and a quintessential symbol of New York City". It gives its name to the neighborhood around it, known as the Flatiron District. It has become an icon of New York City. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989.

Basophil

Basophils, or basophil granulocytes, are rare granulocytes. If you had 10,000 white blood cells, only 1–30 of them would be basophils. 
Basophils contain large cytoplasmic granules. When stained, the granules hide the cell nucleus from sight. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has two lobes. 
The mast cell, another granulocyte, is similar in appearance and function. Both cell types store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they come from different cell lines. Mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead stay in connective tissue. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils go from the blood into a tissue when needed.
The name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are stained by basic dyes, as shown in the illustrations.
How they work is not well understood. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell membrane which binds IgE, an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defence and allergy. They are found in unusually high numbers at sites of ectoparasite infection, for example, by ticks.

<doc id="480736" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=480736" title="Staining">
Staining

Staining is used used in microscopy to make cells and tissues easier to see and understand.
This is a way to improve contrast in the microscopic image. Stains and dyes are often used in biology and medicine to highlight structures in biological tissues, often with the aid of different microscopes.
Staining can be done on living tissues ("in vivo") or on dead tissues ("in" "vitro").
Preparation.
Dead tissue needs to be "fixed" so it does not decay. The fixative keeps the structure as it is. After fixation a tissue may be cut into thin slices, and put on a series of glass microscope slides. Occasionally, it is necessary to dissolve cell membranes so large dye molecules can get into the cells. Standards are published in the "Biotechnic & Histochemistry" journal.
Staining.
The simplest way is to dip the slide plus specimen into a solution of dye, then rinse it and examine. The stains used are certified stains, tested by the Biological Stain Commission. 
Staining bacteria.
Gram staining is used to classify bacteria. It is based on the composition of their cell wall. Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls, iodine as a mordant, and a counterstain which marks all bacteria. 
Gram-positive bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their cell wall lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.
On most Gram-stained preparations, Gram-negative organisms are red or pink from the counterstain. 
Staining tissues.
Haematoxylin and eosin staining is often used in histology for thin sections of tissue. Haematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red. 
Eosin is strongly absorbed by red blood cells, colouring them bright red. In a skilfully made H & E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) go different shades of pink. Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures (such as RNA-rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage) blue. In contrast, eosin stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink.
A quick and simple stain used on blood smears, and human cheek cells is methylene blue, which stains the nuclei. There are many other specialist stains, some fluorescent under special light.

A lunar calendar is a calendar that is based on the phases of the Moon. Because there are slightly more than twelve lunar months (29.53 days each) in a solar year, the period of 12 lunar months (354.37 days) is sometimes referred to as a lunar year.
A common purely lunar calendar is the Islamic calendar. It is calculated from one crescent moon to the next crescent moon. A feature of the Islamic calendar is that a year is always 12 months. So the months are not linked with the seasons. They drift each solar year by 11 to 12 days. It comes back to the position it had in relation to the solar year approximately every 33 Islamic years. It is used mainly for religious purposes, but in Saudi Arabia it is the official calendar. Other lunar calendars often include extra months added occasionally to synchronize it with the solar calendar.
The oldest known lunar calendar was found in Scotland. It dates back to around 8,000 BC.

St. John's Park used to be a park in Lower Manhattan, New York City. It was square-shaped. To the west, north, east, and south were Varick, Laight, Hudson, and Beach Streets. The park is now a traffic circle at the Manhattan end of the Holland Tunnel to New Jersey.
It used to be a farm belonging to a New Netherland farmer. Then, the country of England gave the park to Trinity Church. The church built St. John's Chapel, as well as some townhouses, around the park. By 1827, people living in the area were very rich. In the 1850s, many rich people moved out. In 1866, Cornelius Vanderbilt bought the park for a railroad terminal. The terminal was destroyed in 1927. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Holland Tunnel was built in 1927.

Archaeoceti

The Archaeoceti ('ancient whales'), or Zeuglodontes in older literature, is a group of primitive cetaceans. They lived from the early Eocene to the late Oligocene, 55–23 million years ago (mya). They were the first cetacean radiation, and they include the first amphibious stages in cetacean evolution. So they are the ancestors of both modern cetacean suborders, Mysticeti and Odontoceti.
Thw group evolved in the shallow waters that separated India and Asia 55–45 mya. About 30 species have been found which were adapted to a fully oceanic life. Modern characters such as echolocation and filter-feeding evolved later, in a second radiation 35.
All archaeocetes from 55–48 mya are only from Indo-Pakistan. By 41–34 mya genera are known from across the Earth, including North America, Egypt, New Zealand, and Europe. They were very unlikely to be as well-adapted to the open ocean as living cetaceans, so they probably got to North America along coastal waters. They could have gone around Africa and over to South America. More likely, over the Tethys Sea (between Eurasia and Africa) and along the coasts of Europe, Greenland, and North America.
The group is a paraphyletic because it gave rise to the two separate modern suborders.

Random Hearts

Random Hearts is a 1999 American romantic drama movie. It was directed by Sydney Pollack and was produced by Martin Jurow and Marykay Powell. "Random Hearts" was released on October 8, 1999. The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Warren Adler.
The movie gained mixed reviews from critics and holds a 15% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert said, "There are so many good things in "Random Hearts", but they're side by side instead of one after the other. They exist in the same film, but they don't add up to the result of the film. Actually, the film has no result—just an ending, leaving us with all of those fine pieces, still waiting to come together. If this were a screenplay and not the final product, you could see how with one more rewrite, it might all fall into place."

Music of the Heart

Music of the Heart is a 1999 American drama movie. It was directed by Wes Craven and was produced by Susan Kaplan, Marianne Maddalena, Allan Miller, and Walter Scheuer. "Music of the Heart" was released on October 29, 1999. The movie is based on the true story of Roberta Guaspari, who was the co-founder the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music. It is director Wes Craven's movie outside of the horror/thriller genre to date. It was also his first movie to receive an Academy Award nomination.
The movie gained mixed reviews from critics and holds a 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars and said, "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood."
The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards; Meryl Streep was nominated for Best Actress and scored songwriter Diane Warren was nominated for Best Original Song for the song "Music of My Heart". Streep was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

Transcription factor

Transcription factors help to regulate genes. Each transcrition factor binds to a specific DNA sequence. That is how they control the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA.
Transcription factors are sometimes called a 'sequence-specific DNA-binding factor'. Alone or with other proteins in a complex, they promote or block RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase is the enzyme that transcribes genetic information from DNA to RNA for specific genes.
A defining feature of transcription factors is that they have one or more DNA-binding domains (DBDs), which attach to specific sequences of DNA next to the genes that they regulate. Other proteins such as coactivators, chromatin remodellers, histone acetylases or deacetylases, kinases, and methylases, also playing crucial roles in gene regulation. Because they lack DNA-binding domains, they are not transcription factors.

The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or "dumb bombs" into all-weather "smart" bombs. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an inertial guidance system connected to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. This gives them a range of up to 15 nmi. JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 lb to 2000 lb. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) nomenclature which takes the place of the normal "dumb bomb" nomenclature to which it is attached.

The 2015 Chapel Hill shooting was an incident that happened on February 10, 2015 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Three Muslim college students were shot dead. Their neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks was arrested for it. Families of the victims called it a hate crime. Police do not know why Hicks might have done it. Police in Chapel Hill say Hicks had argued with the victims over parking spaces before. Neighbors said Hicks was obsessed over people parking in his space. His Facebook page says he supports “Atheists for Equality” and blamed “radical Christians and radical Muslims" for causing problems in the world. 
Police are still investigating. The FBI has been called in to help the local police. They have also started an investigation to see if any federal laws have been broken. So far federal officials do not have any evidence it is a hate crime.

<doc id="481258" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=481258" title="Join (SQL)">
Join (SQL)

A SQL Join clause is a way to retrieve information from two or more tables in a database. When a database programmer wants to do a join command, they will type about the databases they want to get information from, and the type of join they want to use. There are five types of joins. A normal codice_1, which is also called an codice_2, a codice_3, acodice_4, acodice_5 and codice_6. 
In order for a join to work, there must be information in the tables to be joined that is the same between them. 
Join (Also called an Inner Join).
Imagine two tables called Employee and Department.
Suppose a database administrator wanted to know what employee worked in what department. While someone could just compare the ID numbers between the two tables, a way to have the information in one place is by doing a JOIN, also known as an INNER JOIN. Because they have one type of data in common, the department ID, the tables can be joined together.
It would make a table that looks like this:
Because Williams in the employee table did not have an department ID, Williams was not printed in the final result.
Outer Join.
Inner joins are fine if both tables have a matching record. However, if one table does not have a record for what the join is being built on, the query will fail. But if a database programmer needs to grab information in an event that there is not a matching record for a row on one of the tables, they need to use an outer join.
Left Outer Join (Also known as a Left Join).
A left outer join (also known as a left join) will contain all records from the left table, even if the right table does not have a matching record for each row. 
So, using the two tables.
This command is ran, which joins the two tables together on a left join.
Unlike the inner join, Williams is printed in the final result, even though Williams did not have a department ID. Because Employee was the left table, or the table first mentioned in the SQL query, SQL returns all of the relevant data needed from it. However, since there was not a department ID for Williams, the Department table was only able to return a null result.
Right Outer Join (Also known as a Right Join).
A right outer join works almost like a left outer join, except with how the tables are handled reversed. This time, all of the relevant information will be returned from the right table, even if the left table does not have a matching result. If the left table does not have a matching result, null will be in the place of the missing data.
So, using the two tables.
This command is ran, which joins the two tables together on a right join.
And this is the final result.
Flexibility of Joins.
Except for how the tables are treated, left outer joins, and right outer joints work alike. This means, in the left outer join example, if a database programmer were to switch the order of the tables listed from this:
to this (notice how employee and department have switched places)
They would receive the same result as the right outer join example above:

Agilodocodon

Agilodocodon was a shrew-sized docodont from the Middle Jurassic. It is the earliest known tree-climbing mammal-like therapsid.
"Agilodocodon scansorius" was about 13 centimeters from head to tail, and weighed about 27 grams. Its appearance was similar to a squirrel, with a long snout, curved, horny claws and flexible ankle and wrist joints typical of modern arboreal mammals. The front teeth were spade-like, indicating that "Agilodocodon scansorius" could gnaw tree bark and eat gum or sap.
This interpretation is questioned by another palaeontologist. He thinks "Agilodocodon"'s teeth "are quite different" from the modern sap-eating monkeys, and the long, thin lower jaw seems too weak for gnawing tree bark.
Discovery.
The fossils of "Agilodocodon scansorius", with the mole-like "Docofossor brachydactylus", were found by farmers in the Chinese Tiaojishan Formation. They were got and examined by the Beijing Museum of Natural History. The species "Agilodocodon scansorius" was reported in the journal "Science" in 2015.

Docodont

Docodonts are an order or suborder of extinct mammaliaforms. They lived during the mid- to late-Mesozoic era. 
They had sophisticated molars, from which the suborder gets its name. In the fossil record, isolated teeth and bits of jawbones are found. 
Docodonts are not quite as closely related to the placentals and marsupials as the monotremes are, so they are not included among the crown-group mammals. 
Because of their molars and their lower jaw being a single bone (the dentary), they are generally regarded as mammals. However, those authors who limit the term "Mammalia" to the (living) crown group exclude docodonts. They use the term mammaliaformes instead.
Docodonts were primarily herbivorous or insectivorous. However, "Castorocauda", adapted to a semi-aquatic life, has teeth which suggest it ate fish.
"Castorocauda" is important because the first find was an almost complete skeleton (a real luxury in paleontology). It breaks the "small nocturnal insectivore" stereotype.
It was noticeably larger than most Mesozoic mammaliaform fossils, and gives absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur. Of course, this strongly suggests mammalian-type temperature regulation.

The squamosal is a bone of the head of higher vertebrates. It is the main part of the cheek region in the skull, towards the back and lower part of the skull.
In mammals, including humans, it fuses with other bones to form the temporal bone. It is then called the 'squama temporalis'. 
In therapsids (including mammal ancestors) the lower jaw is simplified into just the dentary. This hinges against the squamous part of the temporal bone. It is referred to as a 'dentary-squamosal jaw'.

Sanitation

Sanitation means having ways to safely deal with human waste (feces and urine). It also includes ways to maintain hygiene by disposing of garbage, treating wastewater and managing hazardous waste. Sanitation is important because it helps prevent the spread of germs and diseases.
In poor countries, people have poor sanitation because they do not have good toilets. They also do not have good sewage systems. In developed countries, people have good sanitation because they have a sewage system to filter all the toxins from the water. The use of toilets protects the health of a community by keeping germs out of the environment.

Eryops

Eryops is a genus of extinct, semi-aquatic temnospondyl amphibia.
They are found mostly in the Lower Permian-aged (about 295 million years ago) red beds of Texas. Fossils are also found in New Mexico and parts of the eastern United States. "Eryops" also occurs in older Pennsylvanian strata of the Conemaugh Group in West Virginia 
"Eryops" averaged a little over 1.5-2.0 meters (5–6.5 ft) long, so it was one of the largest land animals of its time. It weighed about 90 kilograms (200 lb). It probably had few predators, although the apex predator of the time was the synapsid "Dimetrodon", which was even larger. Several complete skeletons of "Eryops" have been found in the Lower Permian, but skull bones and teeth are the most common fossils.
"Eryops" was better adapted to a terrestrial environment than its ancestors. Sturdy limbs and a strong spine supported the body while out of water.

Putty is a squeezy dough-like material used for filling small spaces. It is often used for woodwork repair. Painters use it to fill holes and cracks in wood. Fireproof putties can be used round electrical boxes in drywall setups. 
Plumber's putty is waterproof, used to make watertight seals in plumbing. Putty is always used for traditional glazing. It fixes and seal panes of glass into wooden frames (or sashes). PVC and metal window frames use synthetic sealants such as silicone. 
Glazing putty is traditionally made by mixing a base of whiting (finely ground chalk) with linseed oil in various proportions. In woodworking, water-based putties are more often used: they have no odour, and are easy to clean up. They work just as well with water-based and latex sealers. There are now synthetic putties of various types. There are epoxy (two-part) putties which dry hard as iron, and holes can be drilled in if needed.

Stone Forest ("Shilin") is a remarkable region of limestone columns. It is in Yunnan Province, China. Two parts of the site, the Naigu Stone Forest and Suogeyi Village are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. They are part of the South China Karst. The site is classified as a AAAAA-class tourist site. This is the highest rating in the Chinese tourist system.
Formation.
The stone forests formed some 270 million years ago in what was a shallow sea. They are mostly limestone, with some sandstone. Horizontal strata were laid down in the basin, and later was pushed up into the air. The limestone in the rocks was then eroded by wind and water to create these spectacular stone pillars. There is a very similar "forest" in Melarky, Madagascar, known as the Tsingy.

The Chocolate Hills are a geological formation in Bohol Province, Philippines. There are at least 1,260 hills (and maybe more) spread over an area of more than 50 km2. They are covered in green grass that turns brown (like chocolate) during the dry season, hence the name.
The Chocolate Hills are a famous tourist attraction of Bohol. They are on the provincial flag and seal as natural attractions of the province. They are in the Philippine Tourism Authority's list of tourist destinations in the Philippines. They have been declared the country's third National Geological Monument and proposed for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
The Chocolate Hills are conical karst hills similar to those seen in the limestone regions of Slovenia, Croatia, northern Puerto Rico, and Pinar del Río Province, Cuba. They probably started as corals growing in a warm, shallow sea about two million years ago. The hills consist of sandy to rubbly marine limestones. These limestones contain abundant fossils of foraminifera, coral, molluscs, and algae. These conical hills were created by limestone dissolving in rainfall and groundwater. There was erosion by rivers and streams after they were lifted above sea level. The hills are separated by flat plains and have numerous caves and springs. The Chocolate Hills are a remarkable example of conical karst topography.

Pyramidion

A pyramidion (plural pyramidia) is the very top piece of an Egyptian pyramid. They were called "benbenet" in the Ancient Egyptian language. In Egypt's Old Kingdom, pyramidia were made of diorite, granite, or limestone. These were then covered in gold or electrum. The gold would reflect the rays of the sun. In later times they were made from granite which had royal titles and religious symbols cut into them.
Very few pyramidia have still exist. Most of those that have are made of polished black granite, with the name of the pyramid's owner cut into them. There are four pyramidia on show in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. They include the pyramidia from the Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III at Dahshur and the Pyramid of Khendjer at Saqqara.:115
A badly damaged white Tura limestone pyramidion is thought to have been made for the Red Pyramid of Sneferu at Dahshur. It has been rebuilt and put on show at the side of the pyramid. However it does not match, as its angles are steeper than that of the sides of the pyramid.
Private brick pyramids with pyramidia.
During the New Kingdom, some private underground tombs had a small brick pyramid built on top of them. These pyramids were topped with a pyramidia. The four sides included texts and scenes about the cult of the Sun god Ra. 
The scenes usually show the course of the sun. It is shown rising on one side, and setting on the opposite side, and traveling, through the night, through the underworld, ruled by Osiris.
Scribe Moses pyramidion.
The pyramidion of the scribe Moses was made about 1250 BC from limestone. It is 53 cm tall and shows him making an offering, with his name, on two opposite sides. The other two sides show a baboon which represents the god Thoth.
Ptahemwia pyramidion.
The pyramidion of Ptahemwia was made about 1200 BC, from limestone. It is 28 cm wide and 42 cm tall, and shows sun-related scenes.:252 The Sun god, Ra, and the god of the Underworld, Osiris, are shown on one side. On another side is Ptahemwia, standing in an offering pose, facing three columns of hieroglyphs.:252

Saqqara

Saqqara (Arabic: سقارة 
 
), or Sakkara, is a vast, ancient burial ground in Egypt, an area of 7 by. It was the necropolis for the Ancient Egyptian capital, Memphis. Saqqara has numerous pyramids, including the world famous Pyramid of Djoser. This is sometimes referred to as the Step Tomb due to its rectangular base, and its 'steps' (mastabas: the Arabic word for 'bench'). It is some 30 km south of modern-day Cairo.
Djoser's pyramid is the oldest complete stone building complex known in history, built in the Third Dynasty. Another 16 Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara, now in various states of preservation or dilapidation. High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the whole pharaonic period. It was an important complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000 years, well into Ptolemaic and Roman times.
The area from Giza to Dahshur was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The official name is Memphis and its Necropolis – the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur. 
Some scholars think the name 'Saqqara' is not derived from the ancient Egyptian funerary god Sokar, but from a supposed local Berber Tribe called Beni Saqqar.

Bramble Cay melomys

The Bramble Cay melomys, or Bramble Cay mosaic-tailed rat ("Melomys rubicola"), is a species of rodent in the family Muridae. While it is similar to the Cape York melomys it has some protein differences and a coarser tail. It is genetically different to species from Australia and New Guinea. It lives in burrows it has dug among plants, or under branches and leaves on the ground. It is a nocturnal animal, and scientists believe it is a vegetarian.
The Bramble Cay melomys is known only from a small population in Bramble Cay, a vegetated coral cay of 340 x. The cay is in the eastern part of Torres Strait, off the northern tip of Australia. It is only 50kms from New Guinea. The melomys were probably trapped on the island by rising sea levels after the last ice age. It is also possible to have come from the Fly River, perhaps floating on branches. Scientists do not know much about the animals that live in the Fly River area.
In the 1800s, there were lots of melomys on the island. A search in 1998 found 42 animals. Another search in 2002 found 10 animals. In 2004 a search found 12, but the melomys have not been seen since. During this time, the sea level has risen, making the island smaller, and turtles and sea birds have eaten most of the plants. Scientists believe the Bramble Cay melomys may be extinct. It is possible that the species may be found on nearby islands as many of these have never been searched.

Koyaanisqatsi is a 1982 movie. It was produced and directed by Godfrey Reggio. The music for the movie was composed by Philip Glass. The movie is a collection of shots from a wide range of places. Most of them show modern life as an unstoppable, almost mechanical sequence of events. The title of the movie, "Koyaanisqatsi" comes from the Hopi Indian language and means "life out of balance" or "crazy life". The movie is designed to make us question our modern way of life and to see that the way we live now is not in balance with nature. The movie shows a number of images, such as the organised demolition of the Pruit Igoe housing complex, the inside of a factory producing endless copies, the faces of strangers in crowded streets and time-lapse images of cars and other vehicles speeding along cities. The effect of the music and the movie together is very powerful. The movie is part of the "Qatsi" trilogy.

A Mastiff is a large type of dog. Typically they have a short muzzle and a short muscular neck. Mastiff breeds have heavy bones and usually ears that hang down. The mastiff is a type of dog that many other breeds descend from. It is one of the biggest breeds of dogs. They can be gentle with family members but are also excellent guard dogs. 
The early mastiff was called a molosser or molossus. Genetics and breeding dogs to get certain characteristics was unknown then. In 350 BC, Aristotle wrote that the ancestor of the mastiff was the molosser. Today the two names are often used to mean the same type. For example, the modern St. Bernard is variously described as a mastiff or molosser type. In ancient history they were originally two different dog breeds. Some dog experts treat them as separate types. When the name mastiff is used to mean a specific dog breed, it means the English Mastiff. Other breeds have mastiff in their name. Examples would be the Tibetan Mastiff and the Neapolitan Mastiff.

Oral tradition says that the tribe would have left Arabia to go to Egypt. According to their legend they rebelled against the Caliph of Baghdad in the second half of the 10th century. In 1049, when the Zirid ruler of Tunisia rebelled against Egypt, nomads were sent to punish them. Ibn Khaldun, an early Tunisian historian, said they were like "a cloud of locusts" when they invaded Tunisia. The Arab poets told of their many conquests as they moved west. They were defeated in a series of battles during the 12th century by the Moroccan dynasty. Even though it was an oral history, the Banu Hilal were a real tribe. They did come from the Arabian Peninsula. And the Banu Hilal did control much of North Africa for over a century.

The sounds could be as simple as someone chewing food with their mouth open. Other examples include a ballpoint pen clicking (repeatedly), tapping, typing and other common sounds. The disorder has only been identified and named in the last 20 years. According to one sufferer, "It’s like a fight-or-flight response: Your muscles get tense, you’re on edge, your heart races, and you feel the urge to flee". Misophonia is often misdiagnosed as one of several psychological disorders. Sufferers often keep away from trigger sounds. There is no cure but it can be treated.

J1 (Y-DNA)

Haplogroup J1, more fully Y DNA haplogroup J-M267, is a Y chromosome of Semitic origin. It carries a SNP mutation known as M267. An SNP is a single nucleotide polymorphism, just a change at one position in a gene's DNA.
Y chromosomes are passed down from father to son, and an SNP like this shows common ancestry. The origin of this mutation was between 4,000 and 24,000 years ago.
This mutation followed a previous mutation, and so this Y chromosome is the "child" of an older version of the Y chromosome. This older version is known as Haplogroup J-P209. It arose from a mutation which occurred about 31,700 years ago in Southwest Asia.

Haplogroup

A haplogroup is a group of single chromosomes, or single DNA strands, which share a common ancestor. They have the same mutation in all versions. 
Haplogroups show deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years.
In human genetics, the haplogroups usually studied are Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. Both can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed only from father to son, while mtDNA is passed only from mother to children. Neither recombines, and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutations with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.

Haplotype

A haplotype is a term in genetics. It is short for haploid genotype. A haplotype is a collection of specific alleles (particular DNA sequences) in a cluster of tightly-linked genes on a chromosome. A cluster is usually inherited together. Put simply, haplotype is a closely-knit group of genes which a child inherits from one parent.
A second meaning of the term haplotype is a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) usually found together on a single chromatid (of a chromosome pair). So, finding a few alleles of a haplotype sequence identifies all other sites in its region. Such information is very valuable for investigating the genetics of common diseases.
Comparing haplotypes of two or more people shows the degree of genetic relationship between their respective lines. It is done in genetic genealogy projects.

<doc id="482140" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=482140" title="Single nucleotide polymorphism">
Single nucleotide polymorphism

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced "snip"; plural "snips") is a DNA sequence variation in a population. A SNP is just a single nucleotide difference in the genome. 
For example, sequenced DNA fragments from two people, AAGCCTA to AAGCTTA, is different in a single nucleotide. In this case we say that there are two "alleles". Almost all common SNPs have only two alleles. SNPs occur most often in regions of the DNA which do not affect the survival of the organism: otherwise they would be weeded out by natural selection. Other factors, like genetic recombination and mutation rate, can also affect SNP density. There are variations between human populations, so a SNP allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another.
These genetic variations between individuals (particularly in non-coding parts of the genome) are sometimes exploited in DNA fingerprinting, which is used in forensic science. Also, these genetic variations cause differences in our susceptibility to disease. The severity of illness and the way our body responds to treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations. For example, a single base mutation in the APOE (apolipoprotein E) gene is associated with a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease.

Myxobacteria

Not to be confused with :slime mould.
The myxobacteria ("slime bacteria") are a group of bacteria that usuallly live in the soil. They feed on insoluble organic substances. They have very large genomes compared to other bacteria. Myxobacteria are included in the delta group of proteobacteria, a large group of Gram-negative forms.
Myxobacteria move by gliding on the surface. They travel in "swarms" with many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. The swarm puts out extracellular enzymes to digest food. This increases feeding efficiency. 
Life cycle.
When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into "fruiting bodies". These fruiting bodies are different shapes and colours, depending on the species. 
Inside the fruiting bodies, cells develop into rounded myxospores with thick cell walls. These myxospores, like spores in other organisms, survive until nutrients are more plentiful. Then cell growth is restarted with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, not just isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the amoebae called cellular slime moulds.
Uses.
Myxobacteria produce a number of biomedically and industrially useful chemicals, such as antibiotics, and export those chemicals outside of the cell. Some myxobacteria are used as model organisms for the study of development. At a molecular level, initiation of fruiting body development is regulated by Pxr sRNA.

She later told Tyra Banks on her talk show, The Tyra Banks Show, that it was a bad experience and she would never do surgery again. She started taking modeling classes at age 12. Two years later she was one of the finalists of the Elite Model Look in Brazil. This launched her modeling career and she signed a contract with Elite Model Management.
Career.
Her first job was appearing on the cover of "Elle" in Brazil. She also did a Guess campaign. 
In 2004, she launched her swimsuit line, "Alessandra Ambrosio by Sais". This was part of a business agreement with Amir Slama's brand Rosa Chá. In 2006, she did a cameo appearance in the movie "Casino Royale". In 2014, she launched her clothing line, "ále by Alessandra" sold at Planet Blue.
Victoria's Secret.
In 2004, she became an Angel, a spokesmodel for lingerie brand Victoria's Secret. She has been walking their fashion show since 2000. From 2004 to 2006 she worked mainly for their younger line, PINK, and is now working for the main line. In 2008, she walked the fashion show three months after giving birth to her daughter. The following year, she opened the fashion show.
In 2012, she was selected to wear the "Fantasy Bra". That year, it was called the "Floral Fantasy Bra". It was created by London Jewelers and featured amethysts, rubies, sapphires and diamonds (including a 20-carat white diamond in the center), making it worth $2,500,000. She walked during the last segment of the year's fashion while wearing it with wings.
In 2014, she was selected to wear the Fantasy Bra again, but this time there were two bras : the "Dream Angels Fantasy Bras" worn by herself and fellow Angel Adriana Lima. Each one of them is worth $2,000,000 and they opened a segment of the year's fashion show while wearing them. It is Alessandra Ambrosio's second Fantasy Bra and Adriana Lima's third.
Personal life.
Alessandra Ambrosio is engaged to Jamie Mazur since 2008. They have two children together: a girl named Anja Louise Ambrosio Mazur (born August 24, 2008) and a boy named Noah Phoenix Ambrosio Mazur (born May 7, 2012).

But many government services are conducted in English. Manitoba is the only province in Canada that is officially bilingual. There are differences between the French spoken in Paris (called metropolitan French) and Canadian French. When the first French immigrants came to Canada they spoke French as it was spoken in France at that time. Since then, Parisian French has become the normal language in France. However both languages are very similar.

Orion Arm

The Orion Arm, or Orion–Cygnus Arm, is a minor spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. It is of interest because the Solar System (including the Earth) is inside it. The spiral arm is some 3,500 ly across and approximately 10,000 ly in length. 
The Orion Arm is named after the Orion constellation, one of the most prominent constellations. It is seen in the Northern Hemisphere during winter and in the Southern Hemisphere during summer. Some of the brightest stars and most famous celestial objects are in the Orion Arm: Betelgeuse, Rigel, the stars of Orion's Belt and the Orion nebula. They are shown on the interactive map below.
The Orion Arm is between the Carina–Sagittarius Arm (toward the Galactic centre) and the Perseus Arm (toward the outside Universe). The Perseus Arm is one of the two major arms of the Milky Way. The Solar system is on the Orion spur, between the two longer adjacent arms Perseus and Carina-Sagittarius.
Inside the Orion Arm, the Solar System is close to the inner rim, in the Local Bubble. It is about halfway along the Orion Arm's length, about 8,000 pc from the Galactic centre.

Irish Civil War

The Irish Civil War (Irish: "Cogadh Cathartha na hÉireann" 
 
The conflict was between two opposing groups of Irish republicans over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The forces of the "Provisional Government" (which became the Free State in December 1922) supported the Treaty. The Republican opposition saw it as a betrayal of the Irish Republic (which had been proclaimed during the Easter Rising). Many of those who fought in the conflict had been members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the War of Independence.
The Civil War was won by the Free State forces. They had many weapons provided by the British Government. The conflict may have claimed more lives than the War of Independence that went before it. It left Irish society divided and bitter for generations. About 927 people died during the civil war.

Chevrolet Cobalt

Chevrolet Cobalt was a compact car sold by the General Motors division Chevrolet from 2005 to 2010. It replaced the Cavalier and the Geo Prizm (although the Pontiac Vibe serves as the Prizm's replacement, many auto sites list the Cobalt as a secondary successor). From 2005 to 2009, it was sold under the Pontiac marque under various names including the Pursuit, Pursuit G4 and the G5. The Cobalt was available as a sedan and coupé, while the G5 was strictly a coupé in America and offered as a sedan model in Canada. It was replaced by the Chevrolet Cruze (a rebadged Daewoo Lacetti Premiere). The Pontiac G5 was replaced by the Buick Verano. As of 2014, GM was recalling this car because of problems with the ignitions that can shut off the engine without warning and cause disabled air bags and cause serious injury or death. Chevrolet Cobalt was considered an improvement over its predecessor the Cavalier because it earned a "Good" crash test rating from the IIHS, but without optional side airbags it earned a "Poor" in side impact tests. However with the optional side airbags it earned an "Acceptable".

Campaign for &quot;santorum&quot; neologism

The campaign for the neologism "santorum" started with a contest held in May 2003 by Dan Savage. Savage is a sex columnist and LGBT rights activist. He asked his readers to create a definition for the word "santorum" in response to then-U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. In his comments, Santorum had stated that "In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be." Savage announced the winning entry, which defined "santorum" as "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex". He created a web site, "spreadingsantorum.com" (and "santorum.com"), to promote the definition.
In 2010 Savage said he would take the site down if Santorum donated US$5 million plus interest to Freedom to Marry. That group supports legal recognition of same-sex marriages. In September 2011 Santorum asked Google to remove the definition from its search engine index. Google refused. They said that the company does not remove content from search results except in very limited circumstances.

Coordinates: 
Ault is a commune. It is in the Picardie region in the Somme department in the north of France.
Ault is on the English Channel, 20 mi west of Abbeville. It has chalk cliffs and a beach of pebbles and sand at low tide. South of the town is a large wooded valley, the ‘Bois de Cise. North of the town the cliffs become smaller, to the level of the beach at Onival. The area around the town, the 'hâble d’Ault' was mostly tidal marshland. This has been reclaimed from the sea and is used for farming cattle and sheep.
Railways.
Ault had a station on the standard gauge Woincourt to Onival line. The line closed to passengers in May 1939, but was used during World War II to move materials for the Atlantic Wall. During the war, a metre gauge line was built at the side of the road from Lanchères, on the CFBS, to Ault. This line was removed after the war.
Sea defences.
The sea is washing away the beach, cliffs and public spaces including car parks and gardens. To protect the coast, a "balcony on the sea", a huge concrete construction has been built, However there are signs of wear on the dyke under the casino.

Yamagata Aritomo (山縣 有朋, June 14, 1838 – February 1, 1922) 
 
 was a Field Marshal in the Imperial Japanese Army. He was twice Prime Minister of Japan. Yamagata was the founder of the Imperial Japanese Army.
Career.
Yamagata was born June 14, 1838 in Hagi. Hagi was the capital of the feudal domain of Chōshū (present-day Yamaguchi prefecture). He was schooled by his father. Yamagata studied Japanese and Chinese literature. He learned the martial arts of "Jujutsu". Yamagata also learned the military use of the spear and how to fence.
He went to "Shokasonjuku", a private school run by Yoshida Shōin. There, he helped overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868. He was a commander in the "Kiheitai". This was a semi-military organization created along semi-western lines by the Chōshū domain. He was a staff officer in the Boshin War (1867 to 1868).
After the Tokugawa were overthrown, Yamagata and Saigō Tsugumichi traveled abroad in 1869. They were sent to research the military systems of western countries. Yamagata was impressed with the Prussian military. After a year Yamagata returned and reported directly to Emperor Meiji in Tokyo. He was made "Assistant Vice Minister of Military Affairs". He used the military theories of Carl von Clausewitz and Prussian war games to change Japan's army. He became War Minister in 1873. He modernized the Imperial Japanese Army and made it like the Prussian army. He started military conscription in 1873. 
Personal life.
Yamagata had no children. He adopted a nephew to be his heir. The nephew was Yamagata Isaburō, the second son of his oldest sister. Then, Isaburō became a career bureaucrat, cabinet minister, and head of the civilian administration of Korea. In his later life he enjoyed landscape architecture, poetry and the rituals of the tea ceremony. Yamagata died on February 1, 1922.

Carol Dempster

Carol Dempster (December 9, 1901 – February 1, 1991) was an American actress. She was a silent movie star who appeared in movies from 1916 through 1926. She married a wealthy banker and retired from the movie industry. In her later years she was famous for her philanthropy.
Career.
Dempster was born December 9, 1901 in Duluth, Minnesota. She was the youngest of four children. Her father was John W. Dempster and her mother was Carrie M. (Acker) Dempster. Her father changed careers when Carol was still a baby and moved the family to California. 
She studied dance at the Ruth St. Denis dancing school. There she was noticed by movie director D. W. Griffith who used her as a dancer in his movie "Intolerance" (1916). Griffith then gave her a role in "A Romance of Happy Valley" (1919). The movie featured the popular acting team of Robert Herron and Lillian Gish. Dempster's first starring role came in the movie "The Girl Who Stayed at Home" (1919). Lillian Gish was supposed to get the role, but was reportedly "tired" and Griffith cast Dempster instead. Critics gave Dempster only mild praise. Her first solo starring role was in "The Love Flower" (1920). It was at this time critics began comparing her to Lillian Gish. But it was Griffith who directed her to sound like Gish and his other legendary female stars. It was about this time that Dempster became romantically involved with Griffith. Her first non-Griffith movie was in 1922. She starred in "Sherlock Holmes" with John Barrymore. Her movie "Isn't Life Wonderful?" (1924) was well received by critics. She starred in two movies with W. C. Fields for Paramount Pictures, "Sally of the Sawdust" (1925), and "That Royle Girl" (1925). Her best performance may have been in her last movie "The Sorrows of Satan" (1926).
Later life.
In July 1929 Dempster was scarred in a car accident in California. A month later she married wealthy investment banker Edwin Skinner Larsen at her rural New York home. After the couple traveled to Europe, Dempster announced her retirement from acting. She and her husband lived in La Jolla, California. She died there on February 1, 1991 from heart failure. Carol Dempster was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale, California. Upon her death, Dempster left $1.6 million USD to the San Diego Museum of Art. The money was to add to the museum's collections of prints and drawings. She and her husband had made several previous gifts to the museum. These included Francisco Zuniga's sculpture "Mother and Daughter Seated" and Thomas Eakins' painting "Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog".

The movie doesn't have the complexity and depth of "Groundhog Day"... but as entertainment it's ingratiating and lovable."

Novospassky Monastery

Coordinates: 
Novospassky Monastery ("New monastery of the Saviour"), is one of the oldest monasteries in Moscow. The first monastery was built in the 14th century. At that time it was inside the walls of the Kremlin. In 1491 the monastery was moved to new buildings on the banks of the Moskva River. It was called the "new monastery". 
In 1571 and 1591, the wooden buildings were attacked by the Crimean Tatars. In 1612, the Tsar, Michael of Russia, had the monastery completely rebuilt. This included the thick stone walls which made it one of the fortified monasteries on the edge of Moscow. These new stone walls were 7.5 meters high and 2 meters thick. They were 782 meters in length, and included six towers. These are the buildings which are still standing. The bell-tower, one of the tallest in Moscow, and the Sheremetev sepulchre in the church of the Sign, were added in the 18th century,
The monastery was supported by Andrei Kobyla's descendants, including the Sheremetyev and Romanov boyars. They used it as their burial vault. Among the last Romanovs buried in the monastery were Xenia Shestova (the mother of the first Romanov Tsar), Princess Tarakanova (a pretender who claimed to have been the only daughter of Empress Elisabeth) and Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia. 
Monastery buildings.
The monastery was closed in 1918 and used as a prison. The cemetery was removed between 1927 and 1930. For a time it was used as a hospital for alcoholics. In 1968 it became a museum of history and an art restoration institute. In 1991 it was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church.

Hebridean Terrane

The Hebridean Terrane is one of the terranes that form part of the Caledonian orogenic belt in northwest Scotland. Its boundary with the neighbouring Northern Highland Terrane is formed by the Moine Thrust Belt. 
The basement rock is formed by Archaean and Paleoproterozoic gneisses of the Lewisian complex. They are overlaid unconformably overlain by the Neoproterozoic Torridonian sediments. This in turn is unconformably overlain by a sequence of Cambro–Ordovician sediments. It formed part of the Laurentian foreland during the Caledonian continental collision.
The Hebridean Terrane is the westernmost strip of mainland Scotland, most of the Inner Hebrides and all of the Outer Hebrides. Similar rocks are also thought to be present on Shetland and have been proved west and north of the Outer Hebrides by BGS shallow boreholes and hydrocarbon exploration wells. The full extent of this terrane to the west is obscured by the effects of Mesozoic rifting.
Some similar rocks occur in the Shetlands, which are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny,

List of pharaohs

This is a list of the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt. It starts in the Early Dynastic Period, before 3100 BC. It ends with the Ptolemaic Dynasty, when Egypt became a province of Rome under Augustus Caesar in 30 BC.
The dates given are approximate. The list of pharaohs uses the dates of Ancient Egypt, developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.
Old lists of pharaohs.
There are old lists of pharaohs which have been discovered. These are not complete:
Other lists can be found in Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Eratosthenes. Two other lists are not believed to be reliable, these are the work of "the Arabic writers", and the "Book of Sothis".
Legendary period.
In the legendary period, there were eight god kings who ruled over Egypt. The Palermo, Turin and Manetho king lists, have different names for the eight god kings.
The god kings were followed by kings who were part god and part human. The old lists are different in naming these rulers.
Archaic period.
The Archaic period includes the Early Dynastic Period, when Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were ruled as separate kingdoms.
Early Dynastic: Lower Egypt.
Lower Egypt was the northern Nile and the Nile Delta. The list may not be complete:
Early Dynastic: Upper Egypt.
Upper Egypt was the Nile Valley, south of the Delta. The following list may not be complete (there are many more of uncertain existence):
First Dynasty.
The First Dynasty ruled from about 3150 to 2890 BC. 
In the interregnum between the first and second dynasties, two short lived pharaohs may have reigned :
Second Dynasty.
The Second Dynasty ruled c. 2890–2686 BC.
Old Kingdom.
The Old Kingdom was a peak of civilisation and achievement. This was the first of three so-called "Kingdom" periods which mark the high points of civilization in the Nile Valley. It began when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty (2686–2181 BC). Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity called the First Intermediate Period, or as the Egyptians called it, the "first illness."
The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was at Memphis. This is where Djoser set up his court. The Old Kingdom is known for the large number of pyramids. These were built as tombs for the pharoahs. The Old Kingdom is called "the Age of the Pyramids".
Third Dynasty.
The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.
Fourth Dynasty.
The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2498 BC. It included the pharaohs who had the Great Pyramids built, Khufu (Cheops), Khafra (Chephren) and Menkaura (Mycerinus).
Fifth Dynasty.
The Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2498 to 2345 BC.
Sixth Dynasty.
The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC.
First Intermediate Period.
The First Intermediate Period (2181–2060 BC) is between the end of the Old Kingdom and the start of the Middle Kingdom.
The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for 94 years, longer than any monarch in history, and died aged 100. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age.
The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.
Around 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. Another line of pharaohs at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable.
Around 2055 BC, Mentuhotep II, the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands. This was the start of the Middle Kingdom.
Seventh and Eighth Dynasties (combined).
The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from c. 2181 to c. 2160 BC. Many of the kings only ruled for a short time from Memphis, with Egypt divided into competing regions.
This table is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I, and the Turin canon. 
Ninth Dynasty.
The Ninth Dynasty ruled from 2160 to 2130 BC. The Turin King List has 18 kings in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. Of these, twelve names are missing and four are not complete.
Tenth Dynasty.
The Tenth Dynasty was a local group that ruled over Lower Egypt from 2130 to 2040 BC.
Eleventh Dynasty.
The Eleventh Dynasty was a local group from Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 BC. The 11th dynasty came from a group of Theban nomarchs who served the kings of the 8th, 9th or 10th dynasty.
The successors of Intef the Elder, starting with Mentuhotep I, eventually conquered Egypt under Mentuhotep II.
Middle Kingdom.
The Middle Kingdom (2060–1802 BC) started at the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. Some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom began to trade outside of the kingdom. This opening of trade led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom, caused by an invasion from the Hyksos.
Eleventh Dynasty continued.
The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is considered to be part of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.
Twelfth Dynasty.
The Twelfth Dynasty ruled from 1991 to 1802 BC. It is considered by later Egyptians to have been their greatest dynasty.
Second Intermediate Period.
The Second Intermediate Period (1802–1550 BC) was a time of chaos between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom. During this time, the Hyksos, who later became the Fifteenth Dynasty, arrived in Egypt.
The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC, the ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty.
The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV. About 1720 BC they took control of the town of Avaris (the modern Tell el-Dab'a/Khata'na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. About 1650 BC the Hyksos, perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered Memphis, which ended the 13th dynasty. When the 13th dynasty collapsed, the 16th dynasty to declared its independence in Thebes. It was soon taken over by the Hyksos kings..
When the Hyksos left Upper Egypt, the Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom, forced the Hyksos out of Egypt and back into Asia 
Thirteenth Dynasty.
The Thirteenth Dynasty (following the Turin King List) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC. Manetho said it lasted for about 154 years. 
The position of the following kings is uncertain:
Fourteenth Dynasty.
The Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the eastern Delta, based at Avaris. They ruled from either from 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC until around 1650 BC. The dynasty had many rulers with West Semitic names and is believed to have been Canaanite in origin.
The position and identity of the following pharaohs is uncertain:
The Turin King List has extra names, but no other evidence has been found.
Fifteenth Dynasty.
The Fifteenth Dynasty was started by the Hyksos people who emerged from the Fertile Crescent. They ruled over much of the Nile region, from 1674 to 1535 BC.
Abydos Dynasty.
The Second Intermediate Period may include an independent dynasty reigning over Abydos from c. 1650 BC until 1600 BC. There are four known kings in the Abydos Dynasty, the order in which they ruled is unknown:
Sixteenth Dynasty.
The Sixteenth Dynasty was a native Theban dynasty. It began during the collapse of the Memphis-based 13th dynasty c. 1650 BC and finally conquered by the Hyksos 15th dynasty c. 1580 BC. The 16th dynasty only ruled over Upper-Egypt.
The 16th Dynasty may have included the pharaohs Sneferankhre Pepi III and Nebmaatre. Their chronological position is uncertain.
Seventeenth Dynasty.
The Seventeenth Dynasty was based in Upper Egypt and ruled from 1650 to 1550 BC:
The early 17th Dynasty may also have included Nebmaatre, whose dates are uncertain.
New Kingdom.
The New Kingdom (1550–1077 BC) includes the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt, from the 16th to the 11th century BC. It is between the Second Intermediate Period and the Third Intermediate Period.
During the New Kingdom, Egypt's armies were able to capture nearby countries. Egypt controlled Nubia in the south, and held territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria. During the New Kingdom, Egypt controlled more territory than at any other time in its history.
Two of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten and Ramesses II. Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, worshipped the god Aten. This is seen as the first monotheistic religion. Ramesses II was a powerful military ruler. He tried to recapture the territories in what is now modern Israel/Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty. At the Battle of Qadesh he led the Egyptian armies in battle against the Hittite king Muwatalli II.
Eighteenth Dynasty.
The Eighteenth Dynasty ruled from c. 1550 to 1292 BC:
Nineteenth Dynasty.
The Nineteenth Dynasty ruled from 1292 to 1186 BC and includes one of the greatest pharaohs, Rameses II the Great:
Twentieth Dynasty.
The Twentieth Dynasty ruled from 1190 to 1077 BC:
Third Intermediate Period.
The Third Intermediate Period (1077–732 BC) marked the end of the New Kingdom. After the collapse of the Egyptian empire, some dynasties of Libyan origin ruled Egypt. This is also known as the Libyan Period.
Twenty-First Dynasty.
The Twenty-First Dynasty was based at Tanis and was a relatively weak group. They were rulers of all Egypt, but in practice their influence was limited to Lower Egypt. They ruled from 1069 to 943 BC
Twenty-Second Dynasty.
The pharaohs of the Twenty-Second Dynasty were Libyans, ruling from around 943 to 728 BC:
Twenty-Third Dynasty.
The Twenty-Third Dynasty was another Libyan group, based at Herakleopolis and Thebes. They ruled from 837 to c. 735 BC:
Rudamun was succeeded in Thebes by a local ruler: 
The Libu.
Not really a dynasty, the Libu were another group of western nomads from Libya who controlled the western Delta from 805 to 732 BC.
Twenty-Fourth Dynasty.
The Twenty-fourth Dynasty was a short-lived rival dynasty in the western Delta (Sais). There were only two Pharaohs, ruling from 732 to 720 BC.
Late period.
The Late Period runs from 732 BC to Egypt becoming a province of Rome in 30 BC, and includes periods of rule by Nubians, Persians, and Macedonians.
Twenty-fifth Dynasty.
Nubians invaded Lower Egypt and took the throne of Egypt under Piye although they already controlled Thebes and Upper Egypt in the early years of Piye's reign. Piye's conquest of Lower Egypt established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BC.
They were forced from Egypt back into Nubia, where they set up a kingdom at Napata (656–590), and, later, at Meroë (590 BC – 4th century AD).
Twenty-sixth Dynasty.
The Twenty-sixth Dynasty ruled from around 672 to 525 BC.
Twenty-seventh Dynasty.
Egypt was conquered by the Persian Empire in 525 BC and ruled by the Persians until 404 BC. The Achaemenid shahs were the pharaohs in this era, forming a "Twenty-seventh" Dynasty:
Twenty-eighth Dynasty.
The Twenty-eighth Dynasty lasted only six years, from 404 to 398 BC, with one Pharaoh:
Twenty-ninth Dynasty.
The Twenty-ninth Dynasty ruled from 398 to 380 BC:
Thirtieth Dynasty.
The Thirtieth Dynasty ruled from 380 until Egypt once more came under Persian rule in 343 BC:
Thirty-first Dynasty.
Egypt again came under the control of the Achaemenid Persians. The Persian rulers from 343 to 332 BC are sometimes listed as the Thirty-first Dynasty:
Argead Dynasty.
The Macedonians under Alexander the Great brought in the Hellenistic period with his capture of Persia and Egypt. The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC:
Ptolemaic Dynasty.
The second Hellenistic dynasty, the Ptolemies, ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. If two dates overlap, that means there was a co-regency. The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII. In modern times she is known simply as Cleopatra. She was the consort of Julius Caesar and after Caesar's death, of Mark Antony, and had children with both of them. Cleopatra tried to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome. This failed with the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony. Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) was the last king of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. He reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt, from September 2, 47 BC. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII, and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. Between Cleopatra's death on August 12, 30 BC, up to his own death on August 23, 30 BC, he was the sole pharaoh. It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian, who would become the Roman emperor Augustus, but there is no evidence. 
Rome.
Cleopatra VII had affairs with the Roman Dictator Julius Caesar and Roman General Marc Antony. She killed herself when Antony was defeated by Octavian {later be Emperor Augustus). Egypt then became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Roman Emperors were given the title of Pharaoh, although exclusively while in Egypt. One Egyptian king-list lists the Roman Emperors as Pharaohs up to and including Decius. See the list of Roman Emperors.

Defragmentation

When file systems store a file, they usually try to store the whole file in one part. When the disk drive fills up, finding an empty space that is large enough becomes more difficult. In such a case, the file systems will split the file into parts, and store each part at a different location on the disk. This process is known as fragmentation. Fragmentation occurs because the different parts are not stored next to one another. When the file is read, it has to be assembled from the different locations. Files that are stored in one part can be read faster. 
Defragmentation is the process of rearranging the different parts, so that they are stored next to each other. This is usually done by copying them to a different place on the disk. Defragmentation is relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives. To read each part, the head of the hard disk needs to reposition itself to the area where the part is stored.
The problem of defragmentation is that it is takes a long time and in some cases, the file system cannot be changed while it is in progress. For that reason, defragmentation should not be done, when it can be avoided.
There are different kinds of files, some of them are modified more often. It is often a good practice to put them on different partitions, as most Unix-like operating systems do. Also, the design of hard drives has changed over time, which will make the effects of defragmentation less visible.
Media that use flash memory, such as solid-state disks, do not profit from defragmentation, as there are no moving parts than need to be re-positioned.

He was known for both his figurative and largely abstract paintings, "rich in imagery, poetry and colour, which are drawn from his environment, the industrial valley towns and mountains."
In later years Cecil suffered from dementia. He was reported as missing from hospital on 21 February 2015, and was last seen in the early hours of 22 February. After a search, his body was found on 24 February in a field near Cwmbran. Gwent Police treated the death as unexplained. They referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because a member of the public had spoken to a police officer about Cecil before his body was found.

Gastric bypass surgery

Gastric bypass surgery is a surgery in which the stomach is divided and the gastrointestinal tract is redirected. The surgery is performed on people who have morbid obesity or have type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or other weight-related health problems. 
As with all surgery, problems may occur. Some people could die after having the surgery.
Gastric bypass surgery can be done using methods that make only small incisions (cuts) into the abdomen. It is one of the most difficult surgeries to perform that way. Advantages of using those methods include that patients don't have to stay in the hospital as long, they have less pain, it doesn't take as long to recover, and the scars are smaller.

Thelarche

Thelarche means the development of breasts in human females during puberty (sexual development). Generally, the left breast is the larger of the two. 
This usually begins when girls are about 9. A lump that is a bit hard appears in each breast under the areola, which is the dark ring around the nipple. The lump in one breast may grow before the other one. This is called breast budding. Within 6-12 months, both breasts will have started growing. The swelling can be felt and seen outside the edges of the areolae. About 1 and a half to 2 years after the breasts first start growing, they are close to the shape and size of an adult woman's breasts. The nipple and areola may be on a smaller mound on each breast. This small mound usually goes away when each breast is fully grown. Breast size depends on the body's amount of fat.
It is the Tanner 2 stage of breast development (a scale used to analyze changes in people from childhood to adulthood). The first stage is the non-developed prepubescent state of breasts. Thelarche is usually the first sign of puberty. It usually occurs after age 8, and is the first evidence of puberty in 60% of women. It usually ends at age 13. However, it can sometimes happen earlier. When this happens, it can be by itself (called isolated premature thelarche). It could also be a wider pattern of precocious puberty (sexual development happening too early). 
The process is started by estradiol, the primary female sex hormone. Many young women are not prepared for thelarche, and this may result in stress. Teaching materials on breast development for elementary and middle schools has been suggested to promote breast health by reducing shame.

The law of the excluded middle is a simple rule of logic. It states that for any proposition, there is no middle ground. Every proposition is either true or false. For example, "Ginger is a cat" affirms the fact that Ginger is a cat. If it is true, then its opposite cannot also be true. If Ginger is a cat, then Ginger is not something else.

Okefenokee

The Okefenokee is a swamp, a National Wildlife Refuge and a U.S. wilderness area. It is shallow, 438,000 acre (1,770 km²), peat-filled wetland straddling the Georgia–Florida border in the United States. 
The Okefenokee is the largest "blackwater" swamp in North America. The term Okefenokee in Native American is "land of trembling earth". The swamp was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974. The Okefenokee Swamp is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. 
The swamp was formed over the past 6,500 years by the build-up of peat in a shallow basin on the edge of an ancient Atlantic coastal terrace, the geological relic of a Pleistocene estuary. 
The swamp is bordered by Trail Ridge, a strip of higher land believed to have formed as coastal dunes or an offshore barrier island. The Suwanee River drains at least 90% of the swamp's watershed southwest towards the Gulf of Mexico. 
Longtime residents of the Okefenokee Swamp, "Swampers", are mostly of English ancestry. Due to their isolation, the Swampers used Elizabethan phrases and syntax well into the twentieth century. The Suwanee Canal was dug across the swamp in the late nineteenth century in a failed attempt to drain the Okefenokee. After the Suwanee Canal Company's bankruptcy, most of the swamp was bought by the Hebard family of Philadelphia, who logged cypress from 1909 to 1927. Several other logging companies ran railroad lines into the swamp until 1942; some remains are visible across swamp waterways. Most of the Okefenokee Swamp is included in the 403,000 acre (1630 km²) Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
A wildfire begun by a lightning strike near the center of the Refuge on May 5, 2007 eventually merged with another wildfire which began near Waycross, Georgia, on April 16 when a tree fell on a power line. By May 31, more than 600000 acre, or more than 935 square miles, had burned in the region.
The Okefenokee Swamp Alliance is a conservation group that works for the continued preservation of the swamp.

Blackwater river

A blackwater river is a river with a deep, slow-moving channel flowing through forested swamps or wetlands. Its colour is caused by the decaying vegetation. As vegetation decays, tannins leach into the water, making a transparent, acidic water that is darkly stained, looking like tea or coffee. 
Most rivers in the Amazon Basin and the Southern United States are blackwater rivers. Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black soil, are black due to the color of the soil. These rivers are "black mud rivers" or estuaries.
Blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater. The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ both from whitewater and clearwater rivers. 
The classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853.

The green woodpecker ("Picus viridis"), or European green woodpecker, is a member of the woodpecker family Picidae. It occurs in most of Europe and in western Asia. There are four subspecies. All have green upperparts, paler yellowish underparts, and a red crown.
The woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on ants on the ground and does not often 'drum' on trees like other woodpecker species. It is a shy bird but usually draws attention with its loud calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19–20 days.
It gives a loud call known as .
Old deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of ants, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, hedges, scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, heaths, plantations, orchards and lawns.

Honeyguide

Honeyguides (family Indicatoridae) are near-passerine birds of the order Piciformes. They are also known as 'indicator birds', or 'honey birds'. 
They have an Old World tropical distribution, with most species in Africa and two in Asia. These birds are known for their interaction with humans. One or two species will deliberately lead humans to bee colonies, so that they can feast on the grubs and beeswax that are left behind.
Brooding.
The breeding behavior of eight species in "Indicator" and "Prodotiscus" is known. They are all brood parasites that lay an egg in a nest of another species. Most prefer hole-nesting species, often the related barbets and woodpeckers, but "Prodotiscus" parasitizes cup-nesters such as white-eyes and warblers. Honeyguide nestlings have been known to throw out their host's chicks from the nest. They have hooks on their beaks with which they puncture the hosts' eggs or kill the nestlings. 
African honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species. The honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching, much as cuckoo hatchlings do. The honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it, so that it has a head start in development compared to the host.

Brood parasitism

Brood parasites are animals, usually birds, which trick other species to raise their young. The best-known example is the cuckoo. The way it works is the parasite develops faster than the resident eggs, kills its nestmates and turfs them out of the nest. The adult birds cannot tell the difference in the young, and spend their time raising the offspring of another species. In some cases, the parasite has the ability to make the begging cheeps of the host species.
Similar methods are used by some fish and insects.

The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces. During World War II, Black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws. Most Tuskegee pilots were trained at Tuskegee Army Airfield. Training bomber crews took longer than training fighter pilots. Navigators and other crew members trained at various army based in the US.

East London

East London is the northeastern part of London. It is east of the City of London.
It does not have an official definition. The idea has its origins in 1720 as "That part beyond the Tower". By 1950 it was called East London and included all of Greater London east of the City of London and north of the River Thames. This area now makes up the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest. It includes one of the highest ethnic minority populations in the country, mostly families of South Asian origin.
The East End of London is a subset of East London, corresponding to areas closer to the ancient City. 
The early development of London eastward was caused by shipping on the River Thames. There were docks and shipbuilding. These industries declined after World War II. Felixstowe is now used as the main container port of southern England. East London is now an area of regeneration. 
Areas further east developed in the Victorian and Edwardian eras following the expansion of the railways in the 19th century. In Tower Hamlets the population peaked in 1891 and growth was restricted to the outer boroughs. By 1971 the population had peaked in every borough and the entire area was experiencing population decline. By the time of the 2011 census this had reversed and every borough had some growth in population.
Many famous places like Spitalfields, Brick Lane and Shoreditch are in East London.

AIDS (MS-DOS)

AIDS is a computer virus that infects .COM and .EXE files. In MS-DOS, the .COM and .EXE files run programs including the operating system. When a computer is infected with this virus, it loads the virus into the computer memory. There, the AIDS virus may infect another .COM or .EXE file each time it is run. AIDS writes on the first 13,952 bytes of an infected executable file. These corrupted files have to be deleted and replaced by non-corrupted backups to remove the virus. 
This virus is also known as the "Hahaha virus" in Europe. IBM calls it the "Taunt virus". When an infected computer starts up, it displays the message "Your computer now has AIDS", with AIDS covering about half of the screen. The system is then halted. It is impossible to recover the original information of the file on the rewritten part.

Maha Al Muneef is the executive director of the National Family Safety Program (NFSP) in Saudi Arabia. She is a pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases in children. Al Muneef has worked to spread knowledge about domestic violence and child abuse. From 2009-2013, Al Muneef also held a position in Saudi Arabia's Shura Council. 
In August 2013, the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia passed a new law to protect people who are attacked or hurt by members of their own family. Al Muneef and the NFSP helped to write the "Protection from Abuse" law. The law describes and explains the meaning of domestic violence and makes it illegal in Saudi Arabia for the first time. 
In 2014, Maha Al Muneef received the International Women of Courage Award. The US President Barack Obama presented the award to Al Muneef during his visit to Riyadh on March 29, 2014. Al-Muneer could not be at the March 4 ceremony in the United States for family health reasons. She received the award in a private ceremony at the Ritz Carlton hotel, where Obama stayed. Obama spoke about the importance of women's rights in Saudi Arabia, and the importance of helping the Saudi king understand this importance. Obama told Al-Muneef he was “so very, very proud of you and grateful for all the work you’re doing here." He added, “I’m looking forward to seeing you do even more wonderful things in the future.” 
The NFSP was created in 2005 in order to combat domestic violence and child abuse in Saudi Arabia. The NFSP started support programs, gave information about the numbers of attacks on women and children in Saudi Arabia, and worked to help people who were attacked or hurt.

Each artist is listed with their dates, place of birth, some places that they worked, their media (the type of artwork that they made), one or two most famous works and some art galleries where their works can be seen.
Late Medieval artists.
Italian Byzantine.
These artists, before the Renaissance, painted in the style of Greek icons. Their paintings were important to the education of many Renaissance painters, and were to be seen in the churches where the Renaissance painters worked, and worshipped. Often an altarpiece by one of these artists was surrounded by frescoes by the Renaissance painters who lived 150 to 200 years later. A famous "Madonna and Child" by Coppo di Marcovaldo stood above the altar where Masaccio, Masolino and Filippo Lippi painted the walls of the Brancacci Chapel. Giotto, who is thought of as the first Renaissance painter, was educated by Cimabue, one of the great masters of the Late Byzantine style.
Italian Proto-Renaissance.
Proto-Renaissance artists worked before 1400 in Italy when the Renaissance style was slowly developing. 
International Gothic.
Artists from many parts of Europe worked in a decorative Gothic style.

Stock (food)

Stock in cooking (cuisine) is a liquid flavoring base for soups and sauces. A flavoured liquid preparation, it forms the basis of many dishes. A stock is made by simmering animal bones and/or meat, fish, or vegetables in water and/or wine, adding mirepoix or other aromatics for more flavour. A newer approach is to use a pressure cooker. The ingredients may include meat, bones, herbs and spices, and mirepoix. Mirepoix is a mixture of onions, carrots, celery, and sometimes other vegetables.
Many use ready-made ingredients like Oxo cubes or bouillon cubes. Stock lasts for three or four days in the fridge, but can be boiled again, and stored again.
The ideas go back to Carême, and were simplified by Escoffier.

Being a conservationist, Deering sited the development of the estate portion along the shore to conserve the forests. The villa was built mostly between 1914 and 1922. The building of the extensive elaborate Italian Renaissance gardens and the village continued into 1923. 
The Vizcaya estate includes the gardens, native woodland landscape and a historic village compound. The landscape and architecture were influenced by Veneto and Tuscan Italian Renaissance models and designed in the Mediterranean Revival architecture style, with Baroque elements. Paul Chalfin was the design director.

Law of noncontradiction

The law of non-contradiction is a rule of logic. It states that if something is true, then the opposite of it is false. For example, if an animal is a cat, the same animal cannot be not a cat. Or, stated in logic, if +p, then not -p, +p cannot be -p at the same time and in the same sense. The law was stated as a principle of mathematical logic by Russel and Whitehead in "Principia Mathematica". 
Ravi Zacharias has said most eastern philosophies reject the law of noncontradiction. The law of non-contradiction is found in ancient Indian logic as a rule in the "Shrauta Sutras", the writing of Pāṇini, and the "Brahma Sutras" attributed to Vyasa. It was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as Madhvacharya. The idea of noncontradiction is rejected in some strands of Buddhism.

Dialetheism is the that some statements can be both true and false at the same time. It is the opposite of the law of noncontradiction (LNC). Because of this dialetheism is completely opposite of what most philosophers call common sense. Graham Priest defines it as believing there can be true contradictions. Priest gives as an example the liar paradox (or liar's paradox). If someone says "everything I say is a lie", then is the statement true or false? In this paradox it can be both.

NKVD prisoner massacres

The NKVD prisoner massacres were a series of mass executions committed by the Soviet NKVD secret police against prisoners in Eastern Europe during World War II. 
The victims were mainly from Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic states, Bessarabia and other parts of the Soviet Union. The Red Army was withdrawing ahead of the German invasion in 1941 ("see Operation Barbarossa"). The death toll came to 100,000 or more. There were nearly 9,000 in the Ukrainian SSR, to 20,000–30,000 in occupied eastern Poland, now western Ukraine, to all Tartar prisoners in Crimea among other places. Not all prisoner victims (150,000 of them in total) were murdered; some were transported into the interior, others were abandoned in prisons or managed to escape because the retreating Soviet executioners could not attend to all of them.

Gave de Pau

The Gave de Pau is a river of south-western France; it is a left tributary of the Adour river.
It takes its name from the city Pau, through which it flows. The word gave is a name given to rivers on the mountains in regions of the western Pyrenees; so, Gave de Pau means "the river of Pau" or "the river that flows through Pau". Many other rivers in the region have the word "gave" as part of their names.
Geography.
The Gave de Pau has a length of about 190.7 km, including the "Gave de Gavarnie", and a drainage basin with an area of approximately 2575 km2.
Course.
The Gave de Pau starts in the Cirque de Gavarnie, in the "Parc national des Pyrénées" ("Pyrénées National Park"), in the "commune" of Gavarnie, Hautes-Pyrénées department, at an altitude of about 2600 m. The upper part of the river is known as "Gave de Gavarnie"; the name "Gave de Pau" is given to the river after the Gave de Gavarnie joins the Bastan river at Luz-Saint-Sauveur.
The Gave de Pau receives its main tributary, the Gave d'Oloron, in Peyrehorade and, from there, it is named as "Gaves Réunis" (United Gaves). Finally, it flows, as a left tributary, into the river Adour in the Landes department, at about 3 m of altitude.
The Gave de Pau flows through 90 "communes". It passes through the following regions, departments and "communes":

Scientists point to the sudden abandonment of the village around the same time as more evidence that the tsunami happened.
A stone semicircle was found which contains seven 600-kilogram (1,320 lb) megaliths. There are cup marks carved into the stones and the stones are around a freshwater spring. It is suggested that it was used for a water ritual. In 2008, there were skeletons of a woman and child found, which revealed the earliest known cases of tuberculosis.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) is a space telescope launched by NASA on July 23, 1999. 
Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope. This is done by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, Earth-based telescopes cannot detect them. Space-based telescopes are needed to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2015.
Chandra is one of the Great Observatories, with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991–2000), and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The telescope is named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

OGPU

OGPU was the secret police of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1934. It was after the Cheka and before the NKVD. Its official name was the Joint State Political Directorate. 
The OGPU was theoretically supposed to operate with more restraint than the original Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka. The OGPU's powers were greatly increased in 1926, when the Soviet criminal code was amended to include a section on "anti-state terrorism". The law were vaguely written and very broadly interpreted. Even before then, it set up tribunals to try the most exceptional cases of terrorism, usually without calling any witnesses. In time, the OGPU's powers grew even greater than those of the Cheka.
Perhaps its most spectacular success was the Trust Operation of 1924–1925. OGPU agents contacted émigrés in western Europe and pretended to be on a large group working to overthrow the communist regime, known as the "Trust". Exiled Russians gave the Trust large sums of money and supplies, as did foreign intelligence agencies. The Trust finally succeeded in luring one of the leading anti-Communist operators, Sidney Reilly, into Russia to meet with the Trust. Once he was in Russia, he was captured and killed. It was a great propaganda success.
From 1927 to 1929, the OGPU engaged in intensive investigations of an opposition coup. Stalin soon made a public decree that any and all opposition views should be considered dangerous and gave the GPU the authority to seek out hostile elements. There were many trials during Stalin's Five Year Plan. 
The OGPU was responsible for the creation of the Gulag system. It also became the Soviet government's arm for the persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Greek Catholics, the Latin Catholics, Islam and other religious organizations. The OGPU was also the main secret police agency for the detection, arrest, and liquidation of anarchists and other dissident left-wing factions in the early Soviet Union.
The OGPU was merged into the newly created all-union People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) in July 1934. Its last change was into the more widely known Committee for State Security (KGB).

Prisoner's dilemma

The prisoner's dilemma is a paradox about co-operation. It hows why two "rational" individuals might not co-operate, even if it seems in their best interests. It is studied in game theory.
Game structure.
Setup.
The police catch two criminals after they committed a crime. The police do not know which person committed the crime and which person just helped. They question the two in separate cells. Each prisoner can either stay silent or betray (hurt) the other by blaming the crime on them. If both stay silent, they only go to jail for 6 months. If one betrays and the other stays silent, the one that stays silent goes to jail for 10 years and the other one does not go to jail at all. If they both betray each other, they each go to jail for 2 years. No matter what happens, the prisoners will never see each other again.
Strategies.
If you are a prisoner in this situation and you only care about yourself, the way to get the smallest sentence is to betray the other prisoner. No matter what, you get a shorter sentence when you betray than when you do not. 
If the other prisoner stays silent and does not betray, then betraying means you do not go to jail at all instead of going to jail for 6 months. 
If the other prisoner betrays, then betraying lets you go to jail for 2 years instead of 10 years. In other words, it's always best for you to betray, even though the two of you would be better off if you both stayed silent. Betraying the other prisoner is your "dominant strategy" because it is always the best thing for you to do, no matter what the other prisoner does.
The prisoner's dilemma does not have same result if some of the details are different.
Game theory was much studied during the Cold War period. In that case the "players" being studied were the United States and the Soviet Union.

Cædmon's Hymn

Cædmon's "Hymn" is a short Old English poem originally composed by Cædmon. It was about God. It survives in a Latin translation by Bede in his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum" and in other dialects written down in several manuscripts of Bede's "Historia". Bede wrote about the poet and his work in the fourth book of his "Historia". 
Cædmon.
Bede told the story of Cædmon who was an illiterate cow-herder who was suddenly able to recite a Christian song of creation in Old English verse. This miracle happened after Cædmon left a feast when they were passing a harp around for all to sing a song. He left the hall after feeling ashamed that he could not contribute a song. Later in a dream he said a man appeared to him and asked him to sing a song. Cædmon responded that he could not sing. But the man told him that he could and asked him to “Sing to me the beginning of all things.” Cædmon was then able to sing verses and words that he had not heard of before. Cædmon then reported his experience first to a steward then to Hild the abbess. She invited scholars to evaluate Cædmon’s gift. Cædmon was sent home to turn more divine doctrine into song. The abbess was so impressed with the success of his gift that she told him to become a monk. Cædmon lived a long and very productive life as a monk. He created songs from all kinds of Church history and doctrine.

Grass snake

The grass snake ("Natrix natrix") is a non-venomous snake. It is often found near water and feeds almost exclusively on amphibians.
The grass snake is widely distributed in mainland Europe, ranging from mid Scandinavia to southern Italy. It is also found in Middle East and northwestern Africa. 
This species is one of only three snakes to occur in Great Britain, the others being the adder and the smooth snake. It is distributed throughout lowland areas of England and Wales. It is almost absent from Scotland and is not found in Ireland, which has no native snakes.

Smooth snake

The smooth snake is "Coronella austriaca". It is one of the three snakes found in Britain, where it lives only on southern heathlands.
It is a non-venomous colubrid species found in northern and central Europe, and as far east as northern Iran. In contrast to many other snakes, their scales are flat (not keeled). This gives the snake a smooth texture to the touch, from which it gets its common name.
The smooth snake feeds on smaller animals, especially other reptiles. It subdues larger prey by constriction, although unlike true constrictors it does not actually kill by this method. It reproduces by laying eggs, which are buried in sand in a warm place.

Gimme Shelter

"Gimme Shelter" is a song by English rock band The Rolling Stones. It is the first song featured on their 1969 album "Let It Bleed". Merry Clayton provided vocals for the song along with Mick Jagger. The song was released in 5 December 1969. 
During a 1995 interview with "Rolling Stone", Jagger said:
"Well, it's a very rough, very violent era. The Vietnam War. Violence on the screens, pillage and burning. And Vietnam was not war as we knew it in the conventional sense. The thing about Vietnam was that it wasn't like World War II, and it wasn't like Korea, and it wasn't like the Gulf War. It was a real nasty war, and people didn't like it. People objected, and people didn't want to fight it..." As for the song itself, he concluded, "That's a kind of end-of-the-world song, really. It's apocalypse; the whole record's like that."
In 2004, the song was ranked #38 on "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list by "Rolling Stone". It has also been ranked at #12 on "The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s" list by Pitchfork Media.

Crossbill

The crossbills are a genus, "Loxia", of birds in the finch family (Fringillidae). There are three to five (or possibly many more) species. 
These birds have mandibles with crossed tips, which gives the group its English name. Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.
Crossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cones. The unusual bill shape is an adaptation to get seeds from cones. These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes, where their food sources grow. They move ("erupt") out of the breeding range if the cone crop fails. Crossbills breed very early in the year, often in winter months. This is the time to get the most cones.
They put their beak slightly open between the scales of conifer cones. Then they close their beaks and the tips push the scales apart. This lets them get at the seed (usually two seeds per scale). The point is that, as cones mature, they tend to open when dry and close when wet.
Eventually they fall, and lie on the ground. As they dry the scales naturally open, and any animal can get at the seeds. With their beaks, crossbills can get at the seeds much earlier than any other animal.
Food preferences.
Each species' bill shape is optimised for opening seeds from different species of conifer. Their preferred food sources are:
The relationships between crossbill species has been much studied.

Circumflex

The circumflex is a diacritic (accent) used in French and a few other languages. It is like a little hat on top of a vowel. Originally, it was an "acute accent" and a "grave accent" put together.
In French, the circumflex usually shows the loss of letter, usually the loss of the letter s. Example: maistre (Middle French) > maître (modern French). Here its function is historical. 
Also, less often, the circumflex is used to distinguish between homophones. These are words spelt the same, but with different meanings. Example: "sur" = on, but "sûr" = safe or certain. In those cases the pronunciation of the two words may be different.

Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that 2001 continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed 2010 of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera".

"You Know You're Right" is the first song off American grunge band Nirvana's self-titled 2002 compilation album. The song was released on October 8, 2002. It was the last song that was recorded by Nirvana, before Kurt Cobain's death.
On the "Billboard" charts, "You Know You're Right" was able to peak at #1 on the Mainstream Rock, #1 on the Alternative Songs, and #45 on the Hot 100 charts.
There was a legal battle between Cobain's widow Courtney Love and Nirvana bandmates Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic. Both Grohl and Novoselic wanted to use the song for a Nirvana box-set that was planned but Love did not allow this and blocked it from being released. Love said that the song would have been "wasted" by using for a box set, and said that it would be better-suited for a single-disc collection. The lawsuit was settled in September 2002 and it announced that "You Know You're Right" would arrive on "a one-CD history of the band" called "Nirvana" later that year.
