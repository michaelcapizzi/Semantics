History.
On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc. The website was a publisher of "Ancestry" magazine and genealogy books. The website was founded in 1983 by John Sittner. Originally, the website was a newsletter about genealogy. The "Ancestry" magazine had been launched in January 1994. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon. He was the main owners of Geneva Steel. In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. That same month, Ancestry, Inc., purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church. By this time, Allen and Taggart began operating Ancestry, Inc. independently. 
The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998. More free sites opened up in March 1999. MyFamily.com, had one million registered users within its first 140 days. The company raised more than $90 million in venture capital from investors. On November 17, 1999, the name of the company changed from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, MyFamily.com, and FamilyHistory.com. Sales for 2002 were about $62 million, and those for 2003 were $99 million. The company opened a call center in Provo, Utah, in March 2004. On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to "The Generations Network". The company allowed free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers. This service was removed on March 17, 2007. This was because of the lack of a mutual agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored its access to its site at Family History Centers. 
On July 6, 2009, the company changed its name back to Ancestry.com. A year later, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing. That same year, "Ancestry" magazine was no longer publishing after 25 years. On November 5, 2009, Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM). It's first public offering was at 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share. The company had a partnership with NBC for a television series called "Who Do You Think You Are?".
In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its location to San Francisco, California. The San Francisco office focuses on the technology aspects of the company. Their recent works include an iPhone and iPad app. In December 2011, Ancestry.com removed the Social Security Death Index for people who died within 10 years. These records were removed because of identity theft concerns. In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call center for international customers, as well as product, marketing and engineering teams.
In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion. At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories. In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of South African genealogy website Ancestry24 which stopped operating in February 2013.

Background.
Amo Kharal was born in a rich landowning family of the Kharal tribe in the Sandal Bar region of Punjab, in Jhamara village. As a young man he fought against the rising Sikh power led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Later on, as an old man in his 70s, when the rebellion broke out against the British, he also raised a force to fight against them. 
Struggle and death.
Amo Kharal was quite successful in helping the local people and keeping them safe from British troops, keeping up a guerilla warfare against them, for some months. On 26th July 1857, Amo Kharal went with a force to attack the Gogera Jail (now in Sahiwal District) to release some of his companions arrested by the enemy, but was ambushed by them and their local allies. Amo Kharal and his assistant, Sarang, were both killed, fighting bravely.
The deeds of this brave and noble warrior are still remembered and sung by Punjabi poets in "dholas" and "vars", types of poems.

Writing tool

Writing tools are the things we use to write with. Most writing today is done with a computer system, usually a word processing software. But for about 5,000 years, much simpler tools were used. The tools were different in different parts of the world. The raw materials had to be near where people lived.
The Middle East.
The two oldest writing systems come from this area, which also had the earliest agriculture and the first cities. It is not known for sure which came first, or whether they influenced each other.
Sumer.
The Sumerian system used clay as the basic material to write on. They developed a type of writing called cuneiform. Triangular marks were pressed into soft clay tablets by a metal or wooden tool. After the clay had dried in the sun the tablets were baked. Then they were carried somewhere else for others to read. We know that its first uses were for trade, accounting and administration.
Ancient Egypt.
This is the most famous of the old forms of writing. It was invented at roughly the same time as cuneiform, yet was quite different in style, and used different materials. The writing tools used varied according to the material which was written on. Egyptians ended up with three writing systems for the same language. The tools were:
When writing on papyrus, Egyptians used a reed pen. The was hollow, with a nib-like end structure. This was a good example of how writing tools must be got from materials in the local area.
Far East.
The original Chinese system scratched lines onto a bone or turtle shell surface, 1200–1500 BC.
Although Chinese characters can be written with many materials, for the longest period they were written with a brush. The ink was carbon-based. It was moulded before use into an inkstick. This small solid object could be carried easily. To get the ink the writer had to grind the inkstick against an inkstone with some added water. The earliest Chinese inks can be dated back to 12th century BC, with the use of charred (partly burnt) materials and plant dyes. Mineral inks based on graphite were most common. A bit later, soot was used as the carbon source, and animal glue used to bind the ink to the paper (Egyptian ink used gum arabic for the same reason).
Paper was a Chinese invention, and a very important one. Essentially the same writing tools and methods were used in Japan, and in Korea, two countries influenced by China. 
Rome.
The Romans used lead styli with wax tablets which could be "erased" by rubbing the beeswax surface smooth again. For permanent records they wrote on parchment (treated animal skin) with ink. They invented the idea of a book with sewn-together parchment pages. It was called a codex, a word which means something like 'block of wood'. Before, long documents were kept in a roll.
Pens.
Dip-in pens were used in Europe for a thousand years or more. At first they were quill pens made of the stem ('rachis') of a pigeon feather. The quill pen was cut by a knife to give the slanting nib at the writing end. They were used from the middle ages until the first part of the 19th century.
Metal pens were tried next, but many metals were not flexible enough. The writing styles which developed with quill pens used thick and thin strokes. People wanted the same flexibility from a metal pen. Between 1839 and 1849 the steel-nibbed pen solved the problem. For the next century and more, industrial production lines turned out hundreds of millions of steel nibs. They had the advantage that different types of nib could be attached to the same holder. This allowed for different styles of writing to be used. Eventually the best nibs were tipped with gold or iridium, a rare metal which arrives on Earth via meteorites. All stages in the making of nibs was done by machine. The great secret of all nibs from the Egyptian reed to the steel pen is the slit down the middle of the tip. This leads the ink from the small blob under the nib to the point where the ink goes onto the paper. Without the slit, a nib does not work kell.

Timeline

A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in the order they happened (called chronological order). It may be in the form of a list or a graphic design. A graphic timeline typically shows a long bar labelled with dates and usually events. But it can be other layouts as well. 
Uses of timelines.
Timelines are often used in education. They help students and researchers understand the order or chronology of historical events for a subject. A timeline can be used to visualize the time between events, durations (such as a lifetimes or wars), and the overlap of events. 
History.
Timelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for biographies.
Project management.
Another type of timeline is used for project management. They are important to help team members to know what milestones need to be achieved. It also shows the time schedule. An example is showing a project timeline for a Systems development life cycle of a computer system.

Heer Ranjha

Heer Ranjha is a famous sad, love story from the Punjab (now in Pakistan). Other Punjabi love stories are Mirza Sahiba, and Sohni Mahiwal.
The story is about two lovers, Heer a beautiful village girl from a rich and noble family; and Ranjha, a poor farm boy.He looks after Water buffaloes belonging to Heer's father. They both fall in love but Heer's parents are against their marriage. Heer is married by force to a rich young man. Ranjha, very saddened by this, becomes a hermit (a person who lives alone away from other people and spends his time meditating about God). He later tries to meet Heer but he fails, and they both die in the end of broken hearts. 
This story has been written by different writers, at different times. The best and most famous is "Heer" by the poet Waris Shah written in 1761. Some films in Punjabi language and Urdu have also been made about this story. 
The story is still very popular in Pakistan today. Many young girls and boys who fall in love have to face the same problems Some people believe that there were two real young lovers called Heer and Ranjha, long ago. They say that they died and were buried together in a tomb near Jhang, in Punjab,Pakistan. But there is no real proof this was so.

Mountain man

A mountain man was an explorer, trailblazer, and animal trapper in western North America. They flourished between 1810 and 1880. They were well known throughout the Rocky Mountains region. Famous mountain men include Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, and Jedediah Smith. By the mid 1800s the fur trade was no longer profitable. Furs were no longer popular in European fashion. Many of the mountain men settled into jobs as Army Scouts, wagon train guides and settlers through the lands which they had helped open up. Others, like William Sublette, opened up fort-trading posts along the Oregon Trail for the remaining fur traders and settlers heading west.

American Shorthair

The American Shorthair is a breed of cat. These cats came on ships sailing from Europe to North America with early settlers. This kept the ships free of mice and rats and protected the food and cargo. Even the Mayflower carried several cats to hunt the ship’s rats, in 1620. The cats who were still alive after landing in the New World had kittens. Over time, the breed changed so the cats could survive better in their new land and climate.
Appearance.
The American Shorthair is a working cat. It has a large and strong body. It is usually healthy, calm and loving with its owners. This cat is friendly and not shy with strangers. Males weigh eleven to fifteen pounds. Females weigh eight to twelve pounds. It takes three or four years for them to become adult cats. With a good diet and good care, they can live 15 years or longer.
The American Shorthair comes in more than eighty different colors and patterns. These include a brown-patched tabby, a blue-eyed white, shaded silvers, smokes and calicos. Some even come in deep shades of black or brown. Only hybrid cats that are chocolate, sable, lavender, lilac, or a Siamese pattern are not allowed in cat shows.
Behavior.
American Shorthairs are intelligent cats who are interested in what is happening around them. They will watch outdoor birds, other animals and other activity from an inside window perch. These cats are calm but playful. Some enjoy sitting in laps. They get along with children, so they make good family pets. American Shorthairs are social cats, but still like to have their own way. They use their hunting skills to catch insects or pests that come into the house.
History.
In the early 20th century, a breeding program was started to develop the best qualities of these cats who came from Europe. Before, there had not been a lot of mixed breeds that had the American Shorthair background. 
The American Shorthair cat now has standards set by cat fanciers of the breed. The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. In 1966, the breed was given the name "American Shorthair". This was to separate the pure breed cat from the many mixed domestic short-haired cats that live all over North America. All these short haired cats are called "working cats" because they were used to catch rodents on ships and farms.

Lynching of Jesse Washington

Jesse Washington was lynched in Waco, Texas, on May 15, 1916. Washington was a teenage African American who worked on a farm. The event became a well-known example of racially motivated lynching. Washington was accused of raping and killing Lucy Fryer. Fryer was the wife of Washington's white boss in rural Robinson, Texas. No one saw Washington commit the crime. During his interrogation by the McLennan County sheriff, he signed a confession and described the location of the weapon used to kill Fryer.
Washington was tried for murder in Waco. There were angry locals in the courtroom. Washington pleaded guilty and was quickly sentenced to death. Washington was dragged out of the court by observers and lynched in front of Waco's city hall. Over 10,000 people, including city officials and police, gathered to watch the attack. People enjoyed the attack, many children attended the event. Members of the mob removed his testicles, cut off his fingers, and hung him over a bonfire. Washington was lowered and raised over the fire for about two hours. The fire was extinguished and his burnt torso was dragged through the town. Parts of his body were sold as souvenirs. Pictures of the event were taken by a professional photographer. This provided rare pictures of a lynching while the event was going on. These pictures were printed and sold as postcards in Waco.
Lynching was supported by many Waco residents. It was, however, not supported by newspapers around the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) hired Elisabeth Freeman to investigate. Freeman gathered many details, despite that many residents did not want to talk about what had happened. After receiving Freeman's report, NAACP co-founder and editor W. E. B. Du Bois published an in-depth report featuring photographs of Washington's burnt body in "The Crisis". The NAACP also featured his death in their anti-lynching campaign. Waco was known as a modern and a progressive city. However, the lynching demonstrated that the city did not mind racial violence. The event was nicknamed the "Waco horror". The city then gained a reputation for racism. City leaders tried to stop violence several times in the following decades.
Historians believe that Washington's death helped change the way people view lynching. The media attention the event received made people become against lynching. It was seem as "barbarism" (ruthless) rather than as an acceptable form of justice. In the 1990s and 2000s, some Waco residents wanted a monument for the event. The idea did not gain support in the city.

Kanjar

The Kanjar are a nomadic tribe or group of people of North India, Kashmir and Pakistan. The Mirasi tribes are also probably related to them. These people are also sometimes called by the names of Nath, Banchra and Gashtay. These names are not nice ones, they mean to show that these people are inferior.
In old times, most of the Kanjar people used to live in jungles or forests. They used to hunt wild animals to eat and also keep some goats, cows and Water buffaloes for their meat and milk. Many of them still live like nomads, moving from place to place but some have started to live in towns and cities. Some of them are Hindu and some are Muslims. They are mostly very poor people and do all the dirty jobs that rich people won't do. 
In Lahore, Pakistan, and in parts of Kashmir, many Kanjar women are sold by their families to become prostitutes. They go and live in brothels in the Heera Mandi. Many men will go there to have sex with these poor women for money, but no one will marry them. They think they are 'unclean' or bad.

Anarkali Bazaar or Anarkali Market is an old style market in Lahore, Pakistan.
The name and origins.
The word 'Anarkali' means 'Pomegranate Blossom'. According to a legend this was the name of a beautiful dancing-girl who fell in love with the Mughal prince Selim (who later became the Emperor Jahangir). But the prince's father, the old Emperor Akbar, did not like this and he had the girl arrested and punished. She died and was buried near this bazaar or market. Later, when her lover Jahangir became Emperor he named this place after her. Today, there is still an old tomb near there, which was built by Jahangir in 1615, and people say this is the tomb of the real Anarkali, but this is not sure. Another famous tomb near Anarkali market is that of the Sultan Qutb-ud-din Aibak.
The bazaar today.
Today, the Anarkali bazaar or market is one of the best shopping areas in all of South Asia. Women especially love to go there, because it has excellent clothes, shoes and jewellry shops.

This was because it was in a very conservative area where women were not encouraged to study. Slowly, more and more women started to join this university to get higher education.

During his time with them, he became their first captain, coach, and general manager. He won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens in 1916.
He was born in Belleville, Ontario but grew up in Valleyfield, Quebec. Laviolette was one of the first stars in hockey to be francophone. When the National Hockey Association (NHA) formed in December 1909, (which was replaced 7 years later by the NHL), team/league owner Ambrose O'Brien asked Laviolette to put together a team made up of French Canadian players and play as the "Les Canadiens" franchise in Montreal. Laviolette was able to complete the task in time for the NHA's first season. Some of the first players that were signed to the team were future hall of famers Newsy Lalonde, Didier Pitre and Georges Vezina. The team that he had put together would go on to become the most successful franchise in professional hockey. In 1918, Laviolette lost his right foot in an automobile accident. The accident would end his playing career. There was a benefit game that was held for Laviolette at the Mount Royal Arena in 1921, which Laviolette was the guest of honour and also refereed.
In 1960, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as a lacrosse player and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962.

Shirali Muslimov

Shirail Muslimov (March 26, 1805-September 2, 1973) claimed to be the oldest person who ever lived. He died at the age of 168. This was 46 years older than Jeanne Calment, a French supercentenarian. She has been confirmed as being the oldest person who ever lived. Muslimov got pneumonia in 1972 and died in 1973. As the only evidence of his age Muslimov had a passport issued in 1939. It showed him to have been born in the village of Barzavu in 1805. He claims to have five generations of descendants.
Life.
According to legend, Muslimov worked hard every day, up to 167 years. He did not smoke or drink. He ate fruits, vegetables, wholemeal bread, chicken broth, cheese and yogurt. He had several wives through his lifetime. Muslimov became ill with pneumonia between 1972 and 1973, but survived only to die later in 1973. Muslimov's story was picked up in 1973 by National Geographic Magazine. The article told that on the occasion he still rode horses and tended an orchard planted in the 1870s. National Geographic later recanted on the claim. The same story was told by the Guinness Book of World Records, stated as unconfirmed along with other similar claims. According to National Geographic, he had an 120-year-old wife whom he had married 102 years earlier. However according to his obituary, published by Time magazine, he was survived by his 107-year-old third wife. 
Fame.
The case of Muslimov became known in 1963. This is when a young photojournalist of TASS, Kalman Kaspiev, went to Barzavu to interview the centenarian. The story was picked up by the Soviet press, by the National Geographic, and by the Dannon company, which for promotional reasons suggested that the long life of Muslimov was linked to a diet of yogurt. 
Some Gerontologists doubt his and other similar claims of extreme old age that come from this area. Analysis of Soviet census records show the lifespan in this area is no more than the expected 115 years for all other populations. Muslimov is one of several men to claim extreme longevity. There are twice as many super-long-lived men as women in this area. This is the opposite of all other populations where women usually outlive men. While there there are no accurate records to prove his age, his story captured public attention.

History.
Howe's lyrics were written in November 1861 and first published in "The Atlantic Monthly" in February 1862. She was paid $4.00 for the song. It is based on the music from the song "John Brown's Body". It was made famous by Charles Cardwell McCabe, a Union Army chaplain during the American Civil War.

Château de Meudon

The Château de Meudon was a former royal residence in France. It is most commonly associated with the "Grand Dauphin" the only son of Louis XIV who made it his personal residence. However on the death of the Dauphin the property reverted to the crown and was used by the famous Duchess of Berry (a granddaughter of Louis XIV) and was later ignored under Louis XV and Louis XVI, but became the official residence of the King of Rome from 1812, and was occupied by Jérôme Bonaparte under the First Empire. The main building was largely destroyed in a fire in 1871, and it is now the site of the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon.
History.
There was originally a small manor on the site which was given to the Duchess of Etampes, a mistress of Francis I of France. The family remodelled the building in around 1540 when the property was given to the "Cardinal de Lorraine". At the Cardinal's death in 1574, Meudon reverted to the House of Guise until 1654. In 1679, the château was sold by Servien's heir to Louvois, the minister of Louis XIV, who continued to improve it inside and out, until his death in 1691. Above all, he commissioned André Le Nôtre to construct grand gardens and fountains fed by elaborate hydraulic works. In June 1695, Louis XIV purchased Meudon from the widow of Louvois, with the intention of installing his only legitimate child le Grand Dauphin in the premises. A brilliant period followed. The Dauphin employed "Jules Hardouin-Mansart". Following the death of the Dauphin the property was briefly used by his son Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Dauphin of France. It was then later given to the Duchess of Berry in 1718.
Louis XV employed Meudon as a hunting lodge. Although his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, was installed in the nearby Château de Bellevue, Meudon was eclipsed in his favour by the Château de Choisy. Meudon declined further under Louis XVI, the parterres overgrown, the basins emptied, the park let piecemeal to tenant farmers.
In 1870, the terraces of Meudon were part of the strategic defenses of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War, and the château, damaged by shelling,[6] was occupied by Prussian forces. Forty-eight hours after the signing of the armistice, in January 1871, Meudon caught fire. It burned for three days, until only some exterior walls were left standing

Diffuse axonal injury

Diffuse axonal injury (often shortened to DAI) is one of the most common forms of traumatic brain injury. In traumatic brain injury, the damage is focused to one area of the brain, in diffuse axonal injury, the damage occurs over a larger area of the brain. DAI mainly damages white matter, which makes it one of the major causes of unconsciousness and persistent vegetative state after head trauma. It occurs in about half of all cases of severe head trauma.
Frequently, people suffering such damage fall into a coma; Over 90 percent of the patients with severe DAI never regain consciousness. Those who do wake up often remain significantly impaired.
Other authors state that DAI can occur in every degree of severity from (very) mild or moderate to (very) severe. Concussion may be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury.

Magnitude (astronomy)

In astronomy, magnitude is the logarithmic measure of the brightness of an object. It is measured in a specific wavelength or passband, usually in optical or near-infrared wavelengths. The sun has an apparent magnitude of −27, a full moon −13 and the brightest planet Venus measures −5. The brightest man-made objects, Iridium flares are ranked at −9 and the International Space Station measures −6.
History.
The Greek astronomer Hipparchus first invented our system of apparent magnitude. He gave the sun a -27 magnitude and reduced the numbers for dimmer stars. About 300 years later Ptolemy of Alexandria created an encyclopedia of stars based on Hipparchus' work. The Persian astronomer Al-Sufi took Ptolemy's work and gave Arabic names to the stars some 800 years later. Medieval European astronomers simply translated Al-Sufi's work into Latin which is why many stars today have Arabic names.

Nerve plexus

A nerve plexus is a branching network of nerves which serves a part of the body. Nerves which go to and from the central nervous system bunch up in certain places. Between each vertebra is a plexus of nerves going in and coming out of the spinal cord. Another plexus is underneath each arm. That is a plexus of nerves and also blood vessels which serve every part of the arm, hand and fingers. Under the arm is much the safest place to have these things because of the damage they would get if too exposed. This also explains why arteries are deeper under the surface than veins.

Alpine lakes are lakes or reservoirs at high altitudes, usually over 5,000 feet (1524 metres) above sea level, or above the tree line.
Alpine lakes are usually clearer than lower lakes because the cold water reduces the speed and amount of algae and moss growing in the water. Often the lakes are surrounded by varieties of pine trees, aspens, and other high altitude trees.
Yellowstone Lake is an alpine lake, and so is Lake Baikal.

First Battle of the Masurian Lakes

The First Battle of the Masurian Lakes was a German offensive on the Eastern Front during the early part of World War I. It started on 7 September and ended on 14 September 1914. The battle was the second defeat of a Russian army by the Germans. The first defeat was at the Battle of Tannenberg. At Masurian Lakes the Germans pushed the Russian 1st Army back out of Germany. They couldn't push the Russians back further because of the arrival of the Russian Tenth Army on the Germans' left flank (side). The Russians suffered a defeat and retreated losing about 125,000 men and 150 guns.
The strategy.
Paul von Hindenburg, general of the German Eighth Army, knew the swampy area of East Prussia called the Masurian Lakes. He thought the Russians might attack there so he made plans in case of such an attack. At this time of the war, the Germans knew what the Russians were planning because they could read their messages. The Russians planned their attack on East Prussia with little intelligence of the area. They had no rail transport to move troops. They failed to plan for enough food and ammunition and moved only with horses and infantry. But they had superior numbers and were confident they could defeat the Germans.
When the two Russian armies first moved into East Prussia to form a pincer attack, Hindenburg completely defeated the (First) Russian army at the battle of Tannenberg in August 1914. There the German victory came when German general Hermann von François disobeyed orders and attacked the Russian flank. Hindenburg then turned his army north to attack the Russian Second army at Masurian Lakes in September. François played a major part in this second victory when his First Corps forced back the Russian flank. Under their general, Paul von Rennenkampf, the Russians dug in. He made use of the lakes, rivers and other natural obstacles. Hindenburg used frontal attacks to hold the Russians while his armies tried to surround the Russian trenches. Using a counterattack to hide his movements, Rennenkampf moved his army back to prevent them being surrounded. Over a period of several days the Russian army lost ground. The Russians fought hard but were driven back to the Russian border. Rennenkampf kept his troops in good order as they retreated.
The aftermath.
The loss of 125,000 soldiers did little damage to the 12 million-man Russian Army. But it also meant a loss of about 150 artillery cannons. At the time these were very valuable for the old Russian army. The Germans also had heavy casualties. This showed the German advantage of their modern rail system for supplying and arming their soldiers. But, the push made by the Germans into Russia caused their defeat at the Battle of Augustov. The victories at Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes made Hindenburg a hero in Germany. As a result of his fame, in 1916 he became Chief of the German Staff.

Argument from morality

An argument from morality is an argument for the existence of God. Also called moral arguments, most are apologetic arguments. They argue there is a moral order in the universe and so there must be a God. German philosopher Immanuel Kant devised an argument from morality based on reason. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue. Further, that an afterlife must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this.

<doc id="464619" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=464619" title="Richard Bachman">
Richard Bachman

Richard Bachman is a pen name used by horror fiction author Stephen King.
Origin.
At the beginning of Stephen King's career, the general view among publishers was that an author was limited to one book per year. They thought publishing more would not be seen as good to the public. King wanted to write under another name so he could write more than one book per year. His publisher, Signet Books, agreed to print more books under a pseudonym.
In the start of "The Bachman Books," King said using the "nom de plume" Bachman was to see if his success was due to talent or luck. King said he put out the Bachman books with very little marketing. He did his best to "load the dice against" Bachman. King never found the answer to the "talent versus luck" question. He said he let everyone know that he was Bachman too soon. The Bachman book "Thinner" (1984) sold 28,000 copies during its first printing. When it was told that King wrote the book, the sales went up by ten times. 
The pseudonym King first picked (Gus Pillsbury) is the name of King's mother's grandfather. At the last moment King changed the name to Richard Bachman. Richard is the same as crime author Donald E. Westlake's pseudonym Richard Stark. (The last name Stark "was" later used in King's book "The Dark Half." Bachman was picked from Bachman–Turner Overdrive, a rock and roll band King was listening to at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.
Identification.
King dedicated Bachman's early books — "Rage" (1977), "The Long Walk" (1979), "Roadwork" (1981), and "The Running Man" (1982) — to people close to him. The link between King and his shadow writer was found out after a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, noted things that seemed the same between the writing styles of King and Bachman. Brown located publisher's records at the Library of Congress which included a document naming King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. Brown wrote to King's publishers with a copy of the papers he found. He asked them what to do. Two weeks later, King telephoned Brown himself. King told Brown that he should write an article about how he found the truth. King let Brown interview him. At the time of the announcement in 1985, King was working on "Misery," which he was going to put out as a Bachman book.
Post-outing.
In 1987, the Bachman novel "The Running Man" gave the idea for the Paul Glaser movie of the same name. King did not want his name to be on the credits. The screen credit for the movie went to Richard Bachman.
King used the "relationship" between himself and Bachman as a theme in his 1989 book "The Dark Half." In the book a writer's darker pseudonym takes on a life of its own. King dedicated "The Dark Half" to "the late Richard Bachman." There were plans to make the book a collaboration between the two, but this was later thrown out.
In 1996, Bachman's "The Regulators" came out, with the publishers saying the book's manuscript was found among Bachman's leftover papers by his widow. It was released as a companion novel with King's "Desperation"; the two novels took place in different universes but featured many of the same characters. The two book covers were designed to be placed together to form a single picture. In the foreword by King included with "Desperation" he said that there may be another Bachman novel left to be "found."
The next Bachman book to be 'discovered' was "Blaze." "Blaze" was an unpublished novel that King wrote before "Carrie" or the creation of Richard Bachman. For its publication King rewrote, edited, and updated the entire book. It was published in 2007 under the Bachman pseudonym, with a foreword by King under his own name.
King has taken full ownership of the Bachman name on numerous occasions, as with the republication of the first four Bachman titles as "The Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by Stephen King" in 1985. The introduction, titled "Why I Was Bachman," details the whole Bachman/King story. (In 1996, the collection was reissued with a new King essay, "The Importance of Being Bachman.")
Richard Bachman was also referred to in Stephen King's "The Dark Tower" series of books. In the fifth book, "," the scary children's book "Charlie the Choo Choo" is said to be written by "Claudia y Inez Bachman." The spelling discrepancy of the added 'y' was later explained as a deus ex machina on the part of "The White" (a force of good throughout King's "Tower" series) to bring the total number of letters in her name to nineteen, a number prominent in King's series. In the next novel of the series, "," Stephen King briefly discusses his Richard Bachman pseudonym.
After the Heath High School shooting, King announced that he would allow "Rage" to go out of print. He feared that it might inspire similar tragedies. "Rage" for a time continued to be available in the United Kingdom in "The Bachman Books" collection. Now the collection no longer has "Rage". In a footnote to the preface of "Blaze," dated 30 January 2007, King wrote of "Rage": "Now out of print, and a good thing." King's other Bachman novels are available in the US in separate volumes.
In 2010, King appeared on the FX television show "Sons of Anarchy" in a cameo role. His character, named Bachman, did contract work quietly getting rid of dead bodies.
In issue 29 of the comic adaptation of "The Stand", Richard Bachman appears as one of the top lieutenants of Randall Flagg. He replaced the character of Whitney Horgan from the original book. He is drawn to look like King.
In the 2013 "Grimm" episode "Nameless", Richard Bachman, being a pseudonym of Stephen King, was a plot point. King's novel, "Rage", had its title page used as a prop for the killer to write a note to the police.
Other pseudonyms.
King wrote a short story, "The Fifth Quarter", under the pseudonym "John Swithen" (the name of a character in the book "Carrie"), that was published in "Cavalier" magazine April 1972. The story was later reprinted in King's collection "Nightmares & Dreamscapes" in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel "Blaze", King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that "Bachman" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym .

It was also known for themes including taboo and violence. Émile Zola was the best-known writer of the literary school of naturalism. He was joined by other writers such as Gustave Flaubert, and Alphonse Daudet.

Acidophile

An acidophile is an extremophile organism which thrives in extremely acidic conditions. What "acidic" usually means here is environments at pH 2.0 or below. These organisms can be found in different branches of the tree of life, including Archaea, Bacteria, and a few eukaryotes.
Inside the organisms, their cells are at a normal pH. They have evolved mechanisms which pump protons (H+) out of the intracellular space in order to keep the cytoplasm at or near neutral pH.

Alkaliphile

An alkaliphile is an organism that thrives in extremely alkaline conditions that are harmful to most life on Earth. To be considered an alkaliphile, the organism must have optimal growth in environments with a pH level of 9.0 or above.
Surviving and growing in an environment that has a high pH level is very difficult: Many processes in the cell are obstructed by high pH levels. Alkaline conditions change DNA, and make the plasma membrane of the cell unstable. Alkaliphiles have two basic methods of dealing with these problems: Either they have a way of making the environment more acidic, or they have adapted the cellular processes, so that they work best in highly alkaline conditions. To determine which of the two mechanisms a specific organism uses, experiments are needed.

Counterattack

A counterattack is a tactic used in response to an attack. The modern term became popular in "war games". The purpose is to neutralize or stop the advantage gained by an enemy during an attack. At the same time it is used to regain lost ground or destroy the attacking enemy. A counterattack depends on surprise, speed, and doing what the enemy does not expect. To be most effective it needs to be launched before an enemy has time to get organized and has not yet strengthened his new position. The Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu (544 BC – 496 BC) is the earliest writer who mentioned the advantages of a bold counterattack.

Sacrifice (2009)

Sacrifice (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was held on May 24, 2009 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the fifth Sacrifice event that TNA held.
There were eight matches on the card. The main event was known as the Four Way Ultimate Sacrifice match, which was between TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Mick Foley, against Sting, Kurt Angle, and Jeff Jarrett. Each of the competitors in the match wagered an important aspect of their career: Foley's title, Sting's career, Angle's leadership of the Main Event Mafia, and Jarrett's shares in the company. Two other important matches saw A.J. Styles retaining the TNA Legends Championship against Booker T in an "I Quit" match and Beer Money, Inc. defeating The British Invasion to win the "Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament". 
Sacrifice gained positive reviews. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter thought that the show, "overachieved". Melzer gave attention to the "Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament" finals match and the "I Quit" match. The only thing he criticized was some of the illogical booking tactics that were made by the company. James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch also gave the event a good review but criticized the show in a number of spots, mainly the "I Quit" match: "Best match of the PPV until the finish with Sharmell-Jenna continuing their feud on PPV TV. Keep it on free TV (if TNA is so adamant about continuing this), but don't put that dumb storyline on pay TV. As usual, TNA tries to find a way out of a stipulation. Sucks to rant on that, because the match was awesome and one of Booker's best performances in years."

Pincer movement

 
The pincer movement, or double envelopment, is a tactic in which forces attack both flanks (sides) of an enemy formation at the same time. The pincer movement can be used when opposing forces towards the center of an army. That army responds by moving its outside forces to the enemy's flanks to surround it. At the same time, a second layer of pincers may attack on the more distant flanks to cut off the enemy .
Description.
A full pincer movement leads to the attacking army facing the enemy in front, on both flanks, and in the rear. If attacking pincers link up in the enemy's rear, the enemy is . Such battles often end in surrender or destruction of the enemy force. The encircled force can try to break out or counterattack. A successful flanking maneuver can be difficult to accomplish.
History.
Sun Tzu, in "The Art of War", talked about the maneuver. But he made the point to leave a surrounded enemy an escape route. Otherwise, faced with death, a surrounded enemy would fight much harder. This advice seems to have been followed by General George Patton when his sweeping pincer movement trapped the German army in the Falaise pocket in August 1944.

Sidesaddle

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Riding sidesaddle is a type of horseback riding. Sidesaddle riding uses a special saddle. This saddle allows the rider to sit 'aside' rather than 'astride' a horse. Astride means the rider's legs are opened with one leg on each side of the horse. In sidesaddle, the rider's legs are basically closed and both legs are on the same side of the horse. Girls and women mostly ride sidesaddle. Riding sidesaddle allows them to use a modest posture while showing off their nicest riding habits.
In history.
Women sitting aside a horse to ride began in ancient history. It later became popular in European countries in the Middle Ages. This gave women wearing skirts a way to ride a horse in a modest way while also wearing their fancy clothes. It is still popular with some modern riders.

The Confederate cavalry from Texas and several companies of Arizona militia fought Union Army regulars and Union volunteers from northern New Mexico and Colorado. Colonel Kit Carson commanded the 1st New Mexico (Union) Infantry.

A literary element is a part of books and stories of narrative fiction. It is kind of verbal storytelling. It can be found in any written or spoken narrative. This is different than literary techniques. For example, plot, theme, and tone are literary elements. Figurative language, irony, or foreshadowing are literary techniques.
Literary elements help in the discussion and understanding of a work of literature as basic categories of critical analysis; literary elements could be said to be made by the readers of a work just as much as they are produced by its author. They are a kind of literary education at the primary and secondary level. A set of terms often appear in a school's student evaluations. For example, the New York State Comprehensive English Regents Examinations make students use and talk about literary elements relating to works in each of the two essays.

Theme (narrative)

Theme in writing is what you think is important in a story. It's the big idea of the work.
In contemporary literary studies, a theme is how the central topic a text, book, or story is treated. Themes can be divided into two categories: a work's "thematic concept" is what readers "think the work is about" and its "thematic statement" being "what the work says about the subject".
The most common understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story. It can be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Some examples of themes of this type are conflict between the person and society; getting to adult age; humans in conflict with technology; nostalgia.
A theme may be shown by the actions, words said, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the theme loneliness in John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men". Many of the characters are lonely. It may be different from the book's or author's view of the world.

Figurative language is when a writer describes something by comparing it with something else. It is writing that goes from the actual meaning to get a special meaning.
Figurative language is a difference in fields of language analysis. Literal language is about words that do not go away from their meaning. Non-literal or figurative language refers to words, and groups of words, that change the normal meanings of the words. A literal usage is the "normal" meanings of the words. It has the same meaning regardless of the context.The intended meaning is the same as the real meaning of the individual words. Figurative use of language is the use of words or phrases in a manner where the literal meaning of the words is not true or does not make sense. It "implies a non-literal meaning which does make sense or that could be true".

This zircon is part of a population of zircons in the metamorphosed conglomerate. They were deposited about 3.060 bya, which is the age of the youngest detrital zircon in the rock. 
The zircons are used in research on the conditions on Earth in the Hadean eon. 
Comparisons.
We have samples of rock from the Moon which are older than these zircons. The "Genesis Rock", got from the Moon by astronauts in the Apollo 15 mission, has been dated at 4.46 billion years. This is one of the oldest known rocks on Earth, though it originated on the Moon. During Apollo 16, older rocks were brought back.
The Allan Hills 84001 meteorite was blasted off from Mars by meteorite impact about 4.5 bya, and crystallised 4.091 bya. It arrived on Earth about 13,000 years ago. These figures were got by a number of radiometric dating techniques.

The Province of Quebec was a colony in North America. It was created by Great Britain after the Seven Years' War. Great Britain acquired French Canada by the Treaty of Paris (1763). After a long debate France negotiated to keep the small island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean. Guadeloupe was rich in sugar. By Britain's Royal Proclamation of 1763, Canada (part of New France) was renamed the Province of Quebec. The province extended from the coast of Labrador on the Atlantic Ocean, southwest through the Saint Lawrence River Valley to the Great Lakes and beyond to the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Portions of its southwest (below the Great Lakes) were later ceded to the United States in a later Treaty of Paris (1783) at the conclusion of the American Revolution.

Military intelligence

Military intelligence is information about an enemy or possible enemy. It is information that has first been interpreted and evaluated. It can include the terrain, the weather, and any other information about a theater of operations. Military intelligence gathering has a long history.
History.
By the time of the Battle of Kadesh in c. 1274 BC Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II was known to have had court spies. In the biblical Book of Genesis Joseph thought his brothers were Canaanite spies.
The Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu (544 BC – 496 BC) wrote about the importance of military intelligence. In his book The Art of War he wrote: "If you know both yourself and your enemy you can win a hundred battles without jeopardy." He emphasized the importance of using spies to learn an enemy's strength and what they were doing. He also wrote: "All warfare is based on deception". What he meant was war can even be avoided if you feed your enemy enough bad information. This is also called counterintelligence. Ancient Rome depended heavily on intelligence information to rule it's empire.
When Major General Joseph Hooker took command of the Army of the Potomac he ordered Colonel George H. Sharpe to establish an intelligence unit. In 1863, they established the Bureau of Military Information. The information they gathered was amazingly accurate. They calculated the size of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia within 2% of the actual number. By war's end Sharpe knew more about the Army of Northern Virginia than many Confederate officers. One of the best sources of military information Sharpe's organization had was slaves who used the Underground Railroad to escape the South.
During World War I intelligence became better organized. For the first time Airplanes were used for intelligence gathering. An observer would fly with a pilot and diagram and map battlefields. They would also photograph intelligence targets and count troops. Operators at listening stations reported on enemy communications.
Climate.
Before the 20th century accurate weather information was not available. Military planners had no data on the climate of their target area. In many cases they didn't even have accurate maps of the area. In 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union they did not have any information on how harsh the Russian winters were. They did not have accurate maps of the roads. Between October 1941 and April 1942 the Germans lost between 100,000 and 112, 000 soldiers to frostbite. That is two-thirds of the number of soldiers who were killed in action or missing.
Terrain.
General knowledge of terrain has always been important to military intelligence. But environmental factors sometimes went unnoticed. At the Battle of Agincourt mud was a major factor in the English victory. The extremely muddy ground slowed down the French and made them easy prey for English archers. In the 17th and 18th centuries army quartermasters, in addition to providing supplies, also scouted terrain and planned s the army would take. One of the first major improvements in gaining scientific knowledge of terrain was during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). The Russians used geologists to do a detailed survey of Korea. They also used geologists to advise them in building fortifications.
Having little or no knowledge of terrain has proved costly to many battles in history. During the Pacific War in World War II, the United States forces had little knowledge of the terrain of the many Pacific islands they fought on. After the war, the United States Army Corps of Engineers contracted with the United States Geological Survey to provide detailed geological information on occupied islands.
Modern military intelligence.
In addition to intelligence gathering on other countries, terrorism is also a major concern of military intelligence. Intelligence gathering by examining communications signals has been a regular activity of military intelligence. Since 2005 military and other intelligence services have also monitored the Internet.
In some 21st century countries, military intelligence competes with civilian-led intelligence agencies. Often military and civilian intelligence gathering have different goals and objectives. Both gather their own intelligence and do not always share information. New methods of intelligence gathering, such as video imagery, satellites, reconnaissance aircraft and drones, produce tremendous amounts of raw data. Artificial intelligence is used to analyze this data for information.

A casualty in military usage is a person in military service, who becomes unavailable for duty due to death or injury. It also includes illness, capture, desertion, etc.; or a civilian casualty.
In civilian usage the word "casualty" is properly used for a person who is killed, wounded or injured by some event. It is usually used to describe multiple deaths and injuries due to violent incidents or disasters. "Casualties" is sometimes loosely used to mean "fatalities", but non-fatal injuries are also casualties.

After 1998, he began suffering from both weight-control problems and injuries. His production numbers had fell off severely. The Grizzlies were still using Reeves as their starting center but both his minutes per game dropped and his field goal percentage had dropped. When the Grizzlies were moved to Memphis in 2001, Reeves had to start the season on the injured list because of continuing back pain and he was never able to play another game after only playing two preseason games with Memphis. Reeves retired from playing professional basketball on January 29, 2002.
Since retiring, Reeves moved back to Gans, Oklahoma where he owns a large cattle ranch just outside of Gans and lives with his wife and three children.

Neo-creationism

Creationism is the idea that life on earth was created by God. This idea comes from a literal reading of scripture, very often the Bible. Today, almost all scientists believe evolution is a good explanation. These scientists say that the scientific method does not allow certain explanations, mostly those that include supernatural elements. For this reason, a movement called Neo-creationism wants to re-state the ideas behind creationism and restart the discussion over the origins of life. The followers want to do this in such a way that religious terms are not used, and that there are no references to scripture. This should make it easier to talk to other groups, such as the scientific community or the general public.

Cloud chamber

A cloud chamber is a sealed box with a supersaturated vapour of water or alcohol. When a charged particle (e.g. an alpha or beta particle) goes through it, the vapour is ionized. The resulting ions act as nuclei, around which a mist forms from the vapour. 
The high energies of alpha and beta particles mean that a trail is left by ions produced along the path of the charged particle. These tracks have distinctive shapes (for example, an alpha particle's track is broad and shows more evidence of deflection by collisions, while an electron's is thinner and straight). When any uniform magnetic field is applied across the cloud chamber, positively and negatively charged particles will curve in opposite directions, according to the Lorentz force law.
The cloud chamber was invented by Charles Wilson (1869–1959), a Scottish physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for this work. The first cloud chamber was made in 1911. The invention was used in the early days of atomic physics. It is often called the 'Wilson chamber'. Since then a number of other types of particle detectors have been invented.

Defensin

Defensins are small cation proteins found in animals and plants. They are host defence peptides. They work against bacteria, fungi and many viruses. 
Defensins have 18-45 amino acids including six to eight conserved cysteine residues. Cells of the immune system have these peptides to help kill phagocytosed bacteria. Those cells include neutrophil granulocytes and almost all epithelial cells. Most defensins work by binding to the microbial cell membrane. Once there, they make tiny holes in the membrane which allow vital ions and nutrients to leak out.

These peptides are excellent candidates for medical use. They complement conventional antibiotic therapy. They have a broad range of activity, and are bactericidal as opposed to bacteriostatic. They need only a short contact time to kill bacteria.
There are big differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells as targets for antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are potent, broad spectrum antibiotics. Unlike most antibiotics it seems that antimicrobial peptides may also improve immunity by working as immunomodulators (beefing up the immune stystem).

Mar Menor

Mar Menor (], "Minor sea") is a salty lagoon, in the southeast of the autonomous community of Murcia, in Spain. It separated from the Mediterranean sea by La Manga, a sandbar 22 km in length and with a width ranging from 100 m to 1200 m.
It belongs to four municipalities: Cartagena, Los Alcázares, San Javier and San Pedro del Pinatar. It has a surface area of 135 km2. It has a perimeter of 59.51 km2. The warm and clear water is no more than 6 m in depth. It was called "the largest swimming pool in the world", by famous swimmer and Hollywood actress Esther Williams. 
The water has a high salt content which aids in flotation. It is one of the most popular places in Europe for a wide variety of water sports.
First the Phoenicians and then the Moorish kings, chose this "small sea" as the site of their summer residences. Today, this area attracts all those who seek a quiet place to rest and relax. There are ideal weather conditions all year round.
Ecological importance of the Mar Menor.
At the northern end there are salt marshes which include a wetland of international importance. This area is conserved as a natural park run by the local government. Its Spanish name is "". The microbes that live in this coastal lagoon have been recently described.
In 1994 the Mar Menor was on the Ramsar Convention list for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. The Mar Menor is also part of a Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance and is a Special Protection Area ("ZEPA" in Spanish) for bird life.
The Mar Menor was one of the top 100 finalists for 12 Treasures of Spain announced on 31 December 2007.

A Latin cross or Crux immissa is a type of cross in which the vertical beam sticks above the crossbeam. This is the main representation of the cross by which Jesus Christ was crucified. The Latin cross began as a Roman Catholic emblem but later became a universal symbol of Christianity. If displayed upside down it is called St. Peter's Cross because he was reputedly executed on this type of cross. When displayed sideways it is called St. Philip's cross for the same reason.
A Latin cross plan is a floor plan found in many cathedrals and churches. When looked at from above or in plan view it takes the shape of a Latin cross ("crux immissa"). The Latin cross plans have a nave with aisles or chapels, or both and a transept that forms the arms of the cross. It also has at least one apse that traditionally faces east. Many also have a narthex at the entry.

Walls of Ávila

The Walls of Ávila in central Spain were completed between the 11th and 12th centuries. They are the city's principal historic feature.
About.
The work was started in 1090 by Raymond of Burgundy. Most of the walls appear to have been rebuilt in the 12th century. The enclosed area is a rectangle of 31 ha with a perimeter of some 2516 m, including 90 semicircular crenellated towers. The walls have an average width of 3 m. They have an average height of 12 m. The wall has nine fortified gates. The Puerta de San Vicente (Gate of St Vincent) and Puerta del Alcazar (Gate of the Fortress) are flanked by twin towers, 20 m high, linked by a semicircular arch. The apse of the cathedral also forms one of the towers. The fortifications are the most complete in Spain.
It is possible to walk on the walls for about half their circumference. Some of the walls will never be able to be walked on because they are connected to other buildings. There is a large section of the walls that have not been made safe for people.
The site was registered as a National Monument in 1884. In 1985, the old city of Ávila and its extramural churches were declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO.
The walls were one of finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.

The Cathedral of Santa Maria of Palma is a Gothic Roman Catholic cathedral located in Palma, Majorca, Spain. It was built on the site of a pre-existing Arab mosque. It is 121 metres long and 55 metres wide. Its nave is 44 metres tall. 
The cathedral was styled in the Catalan Gothic style. It has Northern European influences. The building was it was started by King James I of Aragon in 1229. It was finished building in 1601. It sits within the old city of Palma. It is on top of the former citadel of the Roman city. It is between the Royal Palace of La Almudaina and the episcopal palace. It overlooks the "Parc de la Mar" and the Mediterranean Sea.
Fifty years after a restoration of the cathedral had started in 1901 Antoni Gaudí was invited to take over the project. Some of his ideas were adopted. He moved the choir stalls from the middle nave to be closer to the altar. He also made a large canopy. Gaudí abandoned his work in 1914 after an argument with the contractor. The planned changes were cosmetic rather than structural. The project was cancelled soon after.
The Cathedral of Santa Maria of Palma was one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.

Logic programming is using mathematical logic to write computer programs. There are specialized programming languages where the user can directly enter logical statements. Probably the best-known of these languages is called Prolog. Alonzo Church used a form of logic programming in what is known as lambda calculus today. Logic programming has also been used in LISP. 
Programs consist of a set of rules and facts. In most cases, logic programming uses what is called negation as failure or "weak negation:" This means that if it is not possible to derive some clause formula_1 from the facts and rules, the system will assume that its negation is true.

<doc id="465265" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465265" title="Rule of inference">
Rule of inference

In logic, a rule of inference, inference rule, or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion. For example, the rule of inference called "modus ponens" takes two premises, one in the form "If p then q" and another in the form "p", and returns the conclusion "q". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic, in the sense that if the premises are true, then so is the conclusion.
Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule.
Popular rules of inference in propositional logic include "modus ponens", "modus tollens", and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers.

Universal quantifier

In logic the universal quantifier is a quantifier that says that the following proposition applies to all elements of the universe of discourse. An example that uses this quantifier would be the proposition "All men are mortal". Usually, a turned A (∀) is used to denote the universal quantifier, "for all x" is written as either "∀x", "∀(x)".
Predicate logic and Syllogisms look at the properties of universal quantification.
Propositions can be falsified. To falsify a proposition which contains an universal quantifier, it is sufficient to find one element of the universe of discourse where the proposition is false.

Bubo

Bubo is a genus of large owls. It includes the eagle-owls (Old World) and the horned owls (the Americas). This genus contains about one or two dozen species of typical owls (family Strigidae) and is found in many parts of the world. Some of the largest living Strigiformes are in "Bubo". Traditionally, only owls with ear-tufts were included here, but that is no longer the case.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome "b" sequence data supports the decision to put the snowy owl, an eagle-owl adapted to Arctic conditions, into "Bubo".
The fish-owls in the genus "Ketupa", and the "Scotopelia" fishing owls, are also closely related. They might be moved into "Bubus", but that would make the genus rather large. As it is some of these owls, like Verreaux's eagle-owl, are not studied enough. More research is needed.

On September 30, 2014, the first case of Ebola virus disease was diagnosed in the United States. It came from a 42-year-old Liberian national, Thomas Eric Duncan. Even before Duncan's diagnosis, three Americans had been medically evacuated from Africa and treated in the United States for Ebola virus disease. This was during the current Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. Two were treated at Emory University Hospital's isolation unit and one at Nebraska Medical Center.

Doñana National Park is a natural reserve in southern Spain. It is in Andalusia, in the provinces of Huelva and Seville. It is in Las Marismas, where the Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The park covers 543 km². Of that area, 135 km² are protected. The park has marshes, shallow streams, and sand dunes. It was named as a nature reserve in 1969. The World Wildlife Fund and the Spanish government bought a section of marshes to protect it. The eco-system has been in danger from draining the marshes, using river water to irrigate land along the coast, and making tourist facilities bigger. The park is named after Doña Ana de Silva y Mendoza, the wife of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia.
Doñana National Park was one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.

Neanderthal 1 is the name of the first fossil found that was clearly identified as a Neanderthal ("Homo neanderthalensis"). Sometimes this fossil is also called Feldhofer 1, but that name is less common. 
It is not the first fossil found of a Neanderthal, but before this find, the importance of the fossils was unclear. The fossil is part of a skull, with a fragment of the left temporal bone, part of the right scapula (shoulder blade), the right clavicle, both humeri (bones in the upper arm), one radius (a bone in the forearm), both ulnae (another bone in the forearm), five ribs, an almost complete half pelvis, and both femurs.
Studies done in 1999 included a radiocarbon dating of the bones: The bones were fouund to be about 39.900 ± 620 years old. This means this Neanderthal was from one of the last Neanderthal populations in Europe. In the 1990s and 2000s, bones from two other Neanderhals were found nearby, they are called Neanderthal 2 and Neanderthal 3 respectively. Neanderthal 2 has the same age, but a lighter build. Neanderthal 3 was probably a teenager.
Neanderthal 1 was male. At the time of death, he was between 40 and 42 years old.

Michigan Stadium

Michigan Stadium is an American football stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, situated in University of Michigan campus. The Michigan Wolverines play there. It is the largest stadium in the United States and the third largest in the world. Officially, the stadium can hold 109,901 people.
Michigan Stadium was built in 1927. It cost $950,000 to build. At first, it could hold 72,000 people. By the time the stadium was expanded. Every home game since November 8, 1975 has had more than 100,000 people there. That is more than 200 games. On September 7, 2013, 115,109 people were at the game between Michigan and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. That was a record for a college American football game since 1927. It is also an NCAA one-game attendance record. It beat the record of 114,804 people set two years before on the game between the same teams.
Michigan Stadium is used for events besides Wolverines games. The University of Michigan graduation ceremonies are held there every year. The 2014 NHL Winter Classic hockey game was played there. That was a regular season National Hockey League game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings. There were 105,491 people at that game, a record for a hockey game. A 2014 International Champions Cup soccer match between Real Madrid and Manchester United was played at Michigan Stadium. There were 109,318 people at that game. That was a record for a soccer match in the United States.
History.
20th century.
Before moving to Michigan Stadium, Michigan Wolverines played its games at Ferry Field which can hold approximately 40,000. Fielding Yost, the sports director of University of Michigan, recognized the Wolverines need for a larger stadium after some expansions of Ferry Field. He said this stadium is too small for a team with a large number of supporters, and persuaded the regents to build a permanent stadium in 1926. Copied after the Yale Bowl, the original stadium was built and at first could hold 72,000. However, at Yost's request, stadium was expanded to 82,000.
On October 1, 1927, Michigan played against Ohio Wesleyan in the first game at Michigan Stadium and won it easily, 33–0. The new stadium was then formally opened three weeks later in a game against Ohio State Buckeyes on October 22. In front of the 84,401 people, Wolverines won again, 21-0. Five years later, Wolverines spoiled opening of Ohio Stadium in Columbus. In 1930, electronic scoreboards were installed on the Michigan Stadium, making the stadium the first in the United States which keeps official game time.
In 1956, the stadium was expanded to 101,001. The one "extra seat" in Michigan Stadium was reserved for Fritz Crisler, sports director of University of Michigan at that time. 
Before 1968, Michigan Stadium has a rule of "No women or children allowed on the field". Sara Krulwich, a photojournalist of "The New York Times", was the first woman has been on the field.
Since November 8, 1975, the stadium has held over 100,000 fans for every home game. The game against Indiana University on October 25, 1975 was the last home game for Michigan on which less than 100,000 fans were attended.
21st century.
On September 9, 2006, game of Michigan's football game against the Central Michigan Chippewas was delayed at the first time because the thunderstorm have taken place during the first quarter and game was suspended for near by one hour. Michigan's game with Ball State University team on November 4, 2006, was the 200th consecutive crowd of over 100,000 fans. Traditionally, when the game's attendance is announced, the public address announcer (historically Howard King) thanks the fans for "being part of the largest crowd watching a football game anywhere in America today". On September 3, 2011, game between Michigan and Western Michigan Broncos was ended after 1:27 left in the third quarter because of lightning. It was the first time Michigan had a football game called because of lightning. The stadium was evacuated at 6:38 p.m. and the game was called shortly after seven.
2010 renovation and expanding.
On June 21, 2007, the University's Board of Regents approved a $226 million renovation and expansion project for Michigan Stadium. The project included replacement of some bleachers, widening of aisles and individual seats, installing hand rails, and the addition of a new press box, 83 luxury boxes, and 3,200 club seats. The renovation plan garnered opposition from students, alumni, and fans around the country, which waned as the renovation neared external completion.
A disabled-veterans group filed a federal lawsuit against the university on April 17, 2007, alleging that the design of the project did not meet federal standards for wheelchair-accessible seating. On March 11, 2008, as part of the settlement terms of a lawsuit filed against the university pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the university announced that the official capacity of the stadium would be reduced to accommodate additional wheelchair-accessible seating beginning with the 2009 season. The project was completed before the 2010 season.
Renovations in April 2008 caused that year's University of Michigan graduation ceremony to be moved to the Diag.
In August 2011, the University completed a six-month scoreboard replacement project; the new boards measure 4000 sqft each with a resolution of 900 x 1632. The provider, TS Sports/Lighthouse, also installed new scoreboards in Yost and Crisler Arenas. 
Michigan Stadium was dedicated again on September 4, 2010, before Michigan's first home football game of the 2010 season against the Connecticut Huskies, with a capacity of 109,901. After the renovation, the stadium lacked permanent lights, although platforms for temporary lights were included in the design. In September 2010, a few days after the rededication, the University of Michigan's Board of Regents approved a plan to add permanent lights, at a cost of $1.8 million. The lights were first used at the men's hockey game on December 11, 2010. The following season saw the stadium's first night football game on September 10, 2011. The Wolverines defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 35–31.
Since 2011-12 season a Michigan Wolverines lacrosse team play here too. The team will play most of its 2012 games in Michigan Stadium, including a match against Ohio State on April 14, 2012, after the annual Wolverine football spring game.
Seating and surface.
The stadium's original capacity was 72,000, but Fielding Yost made certain to install footings that could allow for expansion up to 200,000 seats. Initially, all seats consisted of wooden bleachers. These were replaced with permanent metal seating in 1949 by Fritz Crisler, athletic director at the time.
From 1927 to 1968, the stadium's field was covered in natural grass. This was replaced with TartanTurf in 1969 to give players better plaeind conditions. However, this surface was dangerous for easy-injuried players, and the stadium returned to natural turf in 1991. This too became problematic, as the field's below-surface location near the water table made it difficult for grass to permanently take root. The field was converted to FieldTurf, an artificial surface designed to give grass-like playing characteristics, in 2003. In 2010, it was upgraded with a brighter and higher quality version of field turf called Duraspine.
Attendance records.
On September 7, 2013, the attendance record for a one American football game was set on Michigan Stadium. 115,109 people saw Michigan Wolverines victory over Notre Dame Fighting Irish 41-30. However, probably a Notre Dame–USC game at Soldier Field in Chicago in 1927 was seen by approximately 117,000–123,000 people. Michigan Stadium also holds the current NCAA one-season average home attendance record, which was set in 2011 at 112,179 fans per game and reset in 2012 at 112,252 fans per game.
With an attendance of 104,173, the ice hockey game between Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans (victory of Wolverines 5-0) set the record attendance for a hockey game. The record probally was broken on January 1, 2014 for the NHL's 2014 Winter Classic. According to unofficial sources, 105,491 pepople saw the nominal host Detroit Red Wings lose to the Toronto Maple Leafs in a shootout 2-3.
On Saturday August 2, 2014, 109,318 people watched Manchester United victory over Real Madrid 3-1 in an International Champions Cup match. The official attendance was the largest for a soccer game in the United States to date, beating the previous record set by the 1984 Olympics Gold Medal Match, when 101,799 spectators saw France defeat Brazil 2-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.

Ghost Festival

The Ghost Festival, also called the Hungry Ghost Festival, is held on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month. Both Buddhists and Taoists celebrate this festival. The belief is that the gate to the underworld opens on the first day of the seventh lunar month. This month is regarded as the Ghost Month. All of the ghosts and spirits are released from hell. They are free to wander for the whole month. People hold ceremonies to welcome the ghosts and spirits. 
History.
Traditionally, the Chinese call Ghost Festival ""Chung-yuan" Festival". Taoists believe it is the birthday of "Yenlo Wang", the Demon King. In the first half of the 6th century AD it became a Buddhist festival. It has kept the same form since then. During the 20th century Republican and Communist governments saw this as a relic of the past. The People’s Republic of China did not allow public religious celebrations including ghost festivals. But reforms in the 1970s allowed these festivals to return. 
Traditional Rituals.
The Offering Ritual.
The offering ritual is the most important part of the celebration. People arrange long tables in front of the houses and temples. This is for offering food to ghosts. At the height of the celebration priests toss food and candy in the air. This is to feed the hungry ghosts. Children, and sometimes adults, scramble to gather the sweets. People also offer the ghosts incense, paper clothes and "spirit money". 
Salvation Lanterns.
Salvation lanterns are used to guiding the wandering spirits and evil ghosts. They are placed at the doors of homes and temples. The lanterns are set up on the last day of the end of the sixth lunar month. They are lit at midnight each night during Ghost month. When the gates to the ghost world are closed, the lanterns are put away.
Releasing Water Lanterns.
Water lanterns are for the water ghosts who died from drowning. They illuminate the waterways to bring ghosts up to the celebrations. This allows the ghosts from the underworld and underwater are able to be in the same space peacefully. 
Stealing the Lone Object.
The stealing the lone object activity is called “Chiang-Gu”. This is celebrated in Yi-Lan. Competitors climb up a tall tower to reach a prize. The game was banned for some time due to people falling and being injured or killed. In 1991 the game was brought back.
Closing the gate of the underworld.
On the first day of the eighth month in the lunar calendar the gates to the temples are closed. This represents the end of the Ghost month. It is the time for the wandering souls to go back to the underworld. A Taoist priest uses a sword to expel away the wandering soul. He shuts the gate of the underworld in the northeast position, and brings the event to a successful close.
Ghost festivals are celebrated across Asia. This includes China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan. It is also celebrated by many of the 34 million Chinese who live overseas.

Five Nights at Freddy's

Five Nights at Freddy’s is an indie survival horror video game. It was made by Scott Cawthon and is powered by Clickteam Fusion. The game takes place in the fictional pizza restaurant, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The player acts as a night security guard with the aim of keeping safe from the animatronic animal characters that are "malfunctioning". To complete the levels of the game, the player must keep the antagonists away from the guard's office, using mechanical doors, lights, and a CCTV camera panel. The animatronic characters in the first game of the series are named Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Golden Freddy.
The game series has a complicated and heavily hidden storyline that has sparked thousands of fan-made theories around the world, with the main goal being a reliable "timeline" of the events and characters in the series. Scott Cawthon, the sole developer of the Five Nights at Freddy's games, has stated that nobody has figured out a completely accurate conclusion of the story. 
In November 2014, a prequel, "Five Nights at Freddy's 2" was released. In 2015, "Five Nights at Freddy's 3" and "Five Nights at Freddy's 4" were released. Another Five Nights at Freddy's game, an RPG, is currently under development called FNAF World.
"Five Nights at Freddy’s" is installed an estimated 4,694 times per day, 
 
[] earning a daily revenue of $12,879. Cawthon has given away $256,499 to a charity livestream, surpassing the initial goal of $15,000.

Hypnagogia

Hypnagogia is the state of mind that exists between being awake and sleep, or just after waking up. 
People in this state may have experiences that resemble hallucinations, but are not. The person usually knows that it is not real, but very often nothing can be done against it. Most of these "pseudohallucinations" are visual experiences. 
Other experiences that may happen are sleep paralysis and lucid dreams. All of these symptoms happen because of the changes that occur in the brain, and they are not linked to a disease.
The writings of Aristotle already talk about hypnagogia. In more recent centuries, many authors have referred to the state. Edgar Allan Poe, for example, wrote of the "fancies" he experienced "only when I am on the brink of sleep, with the consciousness that I am so".
Serious scientific inquiry began in the 19th century with Johannes Peter Müller, Jules Baillarger and Alfred Maury, and continued into the 20th century with Leroy.
With electroencephalography (EEG) in the mid 20th century, detecting such a state has become easier.

Lassa fever

Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is a fever caused by the Lassa virus. It is common in West Africa. One in 80 people who get Lassa fever will die. Some cases are severe and require going to a hospital. These cases have a death rate of 1 in 5. Lassa Fever was discovered in 1969 after two nurses died from the disease. It was named for the town in Nigeria where it was first diagnosed.
How people get Lassa fever.
Lassa fever is transmitted from rodents to humans. It is caused by direct contact with rodent droppings. It can also be transmitted by humans to other humans by their blood. Lassa fever is common in West and Central Africa (around the equator). 
Lassa fever cannot be transmitted by breathing. It is not very contagious between humans. However it is much more contagious among seriously ill patients. Lassa fever is transmitted by humans through skin lesions, mucous that is exposed to the virus, or by a patient's blood. This means healthcare workers (such as doctors and nurses) need to be especially careful in treating patients, or they risk getting the virus themselves.
Symptoms of Lassa fever.
In 80% of cases, the disease does not have any symptoms and does not make people ill. In the other 20% of cases it shows symptoms and becomes much more severe. About 5,000 people die from it each year.
In infected patients, the disease has an incubation period of 5 days to 3 weeks. During this time, the virus remains dormant and does not cause harm. After this time various symptoms begin to appear including:
Diagnosis and treatment.
In laboratories, there are many ways to test if a patient has Lassa fever. However, in many of the affected regions, there is no equipment to do the tests. This means sometimes people may not be correctly tested and identified with having Lassa fever. 
If a patient is diagnosed with Lassa fever, then the patient will be kept away from other people, to prevent the spread of the virus. If found early, it is possible to treat Lassa fever with the medicine Ribavirin. Despite the fact the drug is relatively cheap, the medicine is still considered expensive for many people in affected regions. Patients may also require blood transfusions and rehydration. 
Pregnant women in their 3rd trimester may need their baby's birth to be induced to allow them to stand a chance of survival. 
Due to the use of Ribavirin, fewer people are dying from Lassa fever.
Prevention.
It is not practical to control the amount of rodents in the affected states. Therefore the best way of prevention is to keep rodents out of houses and public areas to prevent people coming into contact with infected droppings. Infected patients should also be isolated to prevent the spread of the virus (by humans to other humans). In rich countries, diseases such as Lassa fever can be easily monitored by public health organisations to prevent outbreaks. Poor countries often cannot afford these services
There is a vaccine which has shown promise in primates. It has not yet been proved effective in humans.

Background.
In 1937 the All India Muslim League was a weak party with very little political strength. It had lost the 1936 general elections in India, quite badly. It needed more support from powerful Muslims to make it strong. The party wanted to help Muslims in India get their rights. So, in October 1937, M.A. Jinnah, the main leader of the Muslim League party, invited some very powerful Muslims to a conference in Lucknow city. One of the most powerful Muslim leaders was Sardar Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, KBE (1892-1942), Premier of the Punjab province and head of the Punjab Unionist Party. He was also invited by Jinnah to this big conference.
Events.
At this conference, at first most of the big and powerful Muslim leaders refused to accept Jinnah's request for help. Only Aga Khan III was ready to support him. At this time, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan thought that it would be bad if the Muslims did not stand united to get their rights. He thought it was time for unity. So, he convinced some other big leaders to join him. These included Sir Saadullah of Assam, Molvi A.K. Fazlul Huq of Bengal, Nawab Sir Hamidullah Khan of Bhopal State and some others. They all went together and told Jinnah that they would support and help the Muslim League. A special agreement or pact was also signed at this time, between Jinnah and Sir Sikandar, called the 'Jinnah-Sikandar Pact'. This pact also said that all the Muslim members of the Punjab Unionist Party could join the Muslim League if they wanted to. Muslim people all over India were very happy to know that now, they had strong support from big leaders.
Effects.
The Jinnah-Sikandar Pact was one of the most important documents and agreements of the Pakistan Movement. According to Professor Stanley Wolpert, '...it made Pakistan possible'. The Punjab was the biggest and richest province of British India. It linked together all the other Muslim areas and provinces. After this pact was signed in 1937, the Muslim League was next able to make the famous Pakistan Resolution at Lahore, Punjab, in 1940. And just seven years later, in 1947, an independent Pakistan was finally made. 
Syed Amjad Ali, a Muslim leader of Punjab said that 'Thanks to the agreement reached between Jinnah and Sir Sikandar in Lucknow, the dream of Pakistan became real. All Pakistanis today should be thankful to these two great Muslim leaders and their wisdom'.

Khaksar Movement

The Khaksar Movement was a fanatical political and social movement of British India. It was probably started in 1931 by the Schizoid genius and leader Inayatullah Mashriqi.
Background.
There are different opinions about the Khaksar Movement and its followers (called 'Khaksars'). Some conservative Sunni Muslims in India and Pakistan believe it was a movement to help reform Islam and guide Muslims to a better life. But many other people believe it was a terrorist or fascist organisation which wanted to destabilise British India and create anarchy. It wanted to then come to power and set up a strict Islamic state, in part of India.
Organisation.
The Khaksars (meaning 'humble persons') used to wear "Khaki" colored (light brown) uniforms and carry sharp blades and spades all the time. They were very well organised and ready to attack other people violently, on the orders of their leaders. That is why sometime they are also called 'followers of Militarism'. In many ways, they resembled the German Nazis and the Italian Fascists led by Mussolini. They were against Britain and its Allies in World War II and wanted that the Axis powers should win. They also opposed the making of a separate Muslim country, Pakistan. They even tried to kill the founder of that country, Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
1940 onwards.
In 1940, the Government of the Punjab ordered that the Khaksar leaders should be arrested in Lahore city. But the Khaksars attacked the official police force very violently, and then the police fired back at them killing many. This was called the 'Khaksar massacre of 1940'. In 1947, when Pakistan was finally made the Khaksars Movement closed down for some time. But later on, it started again. Like the Taliban, it wants to bring an 'Islamic Revolution' there.

Luxor Temple

Luxor Temple is an Ancient Egyptian temple, located in modern-day Luxor, which was known as Thebes at the time. The temple was dedicated to the god Amun, his wife Mut, and their son Chons. The temple was built during the time of the New Kingdom. Because some of the stones were re-used, an older monument was probably there beforehand, during the 12th dynasty. Some of the stones of the temple were later re-used to build Abu el-Haggag mosque. 
Together with the Temple at Karnak, Luxor Temple is on the list of World Heritage Sites. 
Note that Luxor Temple is different from the necropolis of Hatshepsut, located in Deir el-Bahari, which is also near Luxor.

Trace fossil

Trace fossils (or ichnofossils) are geological records of biological activity. They are fossils, but not of the living things themselves. Probably the best-known examples are dinosaur trackways. 
Trace fossils may be impressions made on the substrate by an organism. Burrows, borings, footprints, feeding marks, and root cavities are examples. The term includes the remains of other organic material produced by an organism – for example coprolites (fossilized droppings) or chemical markers. Stromatolites are sediment structures produced by bacteria. Trace fossils contrast with body fossils, which are the fossilized remains of parts of organisms' bodies, usually altered by later chemical activity or mineralization.
Structures which are not produced by the behaviour of an organism are not considered trace fossils.
The study of traces is called ichnology. Traces reflect the behaviour, not usually not the biological affinity of their makers. They are given their own names in taxonomy, based on their appearance and the implied behaviour of their makers.

Lorenz attractor

The Lorenz attractor (also called Lorenz system) is a system of equations. Edward N. Lorenz formulated the equations as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. The equations are ordinary differential equations, called Lorenz equations. They are notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and starting conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or figure eight.
The notion of butterfly effect is coupled with that of the Lorenz attractor. Lorenz first used the phrase in a speech he gave in 1972.

Ordinary differential equation

An ordinary differential equation (often shortened to ODE) is a differential equation which contains one free variable, and its derivatives. Ordinary differential equations are used for many scientific models and predictions. The term "ordinary" is used to differentiate them from partial differential equations, which contain more than one free variable, and their derivatives.

Inoculation

Inoculation (also known as Variolation) is a historical method of making people immune to Smallpox. Unlike a vaccine, inoculation uses infected material (for example scabs) from an infected patient. The benefit of inoculation is it gives the individual a less dangerous type of the virus. Another benefit of inoculation is the fact it has a death rate of 0.5% - 2% (as opposed to the 35% death rate of smallpox). Inoculation was eventually replaced after Edward Jenner discovered a vaccine against smallpox. 
Historical uses.
China.
China may have used inoculation in the 10th century. The Emperor of China at the time lost his eldest son to smallpox. He wanted a way to help prevent smallpox from killing anymore members of his family. He summoned many people from throughout the empire to attempt to find a cure to smallpox. A man carried out inoculation to Immunise his family. However the source of the story was supposedly written 100's of years after the event. 
Inoculation was not widely used in china until the 'Longqing Emperor' in the 16th century. This was written by Yu Tianchi. Inoculation using the most deadly strain of the virus was banned from use in China to prevent high death rates. Inoculation is documented to have been used in India in the 18th century. It may have been used earlier than that but there is no evidence to prove this. 
Importation to Europe.
The practice of Inoculation was first used in England after an ambassador's wife witnessed it in Constantinople. Her name was Lady Mary Wortley Montague and she was impressed at the benefits. She had lost her son, and bore scars of the virus herself. When an epidemic of smallpox occurred in England in 1721, she ordered that her daughter be inoculated. Many people visited her daughter, and were impressed at the results of inoculation. Eventually inoculation was tested in Newgate Prison. This was before the members of the royal family were inoculated. After the success in England, many European countries began to use inoculation against smallpox.
Decline in Use.
In 1796 Edward Jenner discovered a vaccine against smallpox which had a very low death rate. It was also more effective. Inoculation began to be replaced by this new vaccine, and was eventually outlawed in England in 1840. France banned Inoculation in 1762 due to the death rates associated with it.

Apse

In architecture, the apse (from Latin "apsis": "arch, vault") is a semicircular recess covered with a hemispherical vault or semi-dome. It is similar to another form known as an "exedra". In Romanesque, Byzantine and Gothic Christian abbey, cathedral and church architecture, the term is applied to a semi-circular or polygonal termination of the main building. This is usually at the liturgical east end (where the altar is). It is also regardless of the shape of the roof, which may be flat, sloping, domed, or hemispherical.

Damask is a weaving pattern that is usually used with silk or wool. It is a poular classical pattern now usually made in Europe and America. It is made with a special technique: the original Damask was made in Turkey, Syria, Iran and Jordan.
History.
Damask was first made using the five original weaving methods during the Middle Ages. It was common in the Byzantine Empire, and in Islamic areas. Its name comes from the city of Damascus, where the pattern and the manufacturing technique were invented. Damask lost popularity after the ninth century, exept in Andalusia. It was revived by European weaving manufacturers, who got interested in oriental patterns and models. They made it on weaving looms from the 14th century onwards.
Modern uses.
Damask is a pattern used today on computerized looms. Even if the original pattern was a colored one, the modern Damask is usually monochromatic. It is woven in silk, linen and even synthetic materials. The patterns can represent plants, flowers and fruits, but also other classical Arabian designs. The unique characteristic of the pattern is that the light reflects differently, when watched from different angles.

Pokemon Glitches are Glitches in Pokemon. The most famous ones are the Mew glitch and the Old Man glitch in Pokemon Red/Blue, but the only Glitch in this article is the Mew Glitch.
The Mew Glitch.
The Mew Glitch is a method for catching a wild Mew in Pokemon Red/Blue, and it is also known as the Trainer Fly(Escape)Glitch, and it can't be preformed on other generations or other versions(except Yellow/Green).
It is famous for catching Mew, but you can catch other Pokemon this way, and Glitch Pokemon as well, but it can't catch the following Hexadecimal Codes : 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, as the Special Stats can't be lowered below 5.
The way to preform this glitch is to find a Long-Sight Trainer(Example : The Trainer on the way to the Bill's that says "I saw your feet from the grass!"or similar.), a Pokemon that can use Fly, Teleport, or if you're on a cave, Escape Rope, or an Pokemon that can use Dig, a trainer to fight later, and the Pokemon that needs to be transformed(If you are catching Mew, The special stat should be 21).
Go to the Long-Sight Trainer, and stay at the point where you won't be seen by him. Then step down(if you are using the Trainer in the Example)and press Start immediately so the menu would appear, then use Fly or Teleport.
Go to the trainer you wanted to fight later. The things you shouldn't do is Talk to him, and Walk straight to him. If you do that, then you would just crash. Fight him, and after the battle, go to a route that has a Ditto. Fight him, and let him copy the stats that the Pokemon needs to be transformed. End the battle, and go to the way to the Bill's(If you are following the example). A Start Menu will appear, and exiting the menu will make a wild Mew at Lv.7 appear.

Ontario Highway 21, also called King's Highway 21, is a provincial highway in southwestern Ontario, Canada. It starts near Ontario Highway 402, almost half way between Sarnia and London. It runs north/northeast for 227 km and ends in Owen Sound with Highway 6, Highway 10, and Highway 26. The roadway is referred to as the Bluewater Highway because it remains very close to the eastern shoreline of Lake Huron. It was started in 1927 as Highway 3 running across across Kent and Lambton Counties. In 1930 it was extended and renamed King's Highway 21. It is one of Ontario's most treacherous roads for winter driving. Highway 21 is frequently closed during winter because of snow blowing off Lake Huron.

Nuclear DNA

Nuclear DNA is the DNA inside the cell nucleus of eukaryotic cells. This DNA is a double helix, with two strands wound around each other. This double helix structure was first described by Francis Crick and James D. Watson in 1953. 
This DNA is different from the DNA in bacteria, mitochondria and plastids such as chloroplasts. Nuclear DNA is very long, and is bound up in chromosomes which, apart from the DNA, are protein structures. The second difference is that each eukaryote cell has two sets of DNA, one set from each parent: it is diploid. Mitochondrial and plastid DNA is relatively short, is in a circle, and there is only one set (haploid), not two. It is supposed that these organelles were once independent bacteria (see endosymbiosis).
The consequence of nuclear DNA being double is highly important. The genes in mitochondria and plastids only change when a mutation happens. Nuclear DNA gets shuffled by the cell division known as meiosis, part of sexual reproduction. This leads to a variety of offspring from any two parents.
Another feature of nuclear DNA is that it is regulated by proteins and RNA systems which control the rate of transcription into messenger RNA. In this way, most of the cell products are adjusted according to the circumstances.

The Connecticut Turnpike (also known as Governor John Davis Lodge Turnpike) is a freeway in Connecticut. It runs from Byram to South Killingly. It is approximately 135 miles long (94 miles on Interstate 95, 37 miles on Interstate 395, and 4 miles on State Route 695).
The Connecticut Turnpike opened in the early 1950s as the state's main highway. Once the road was considered paid for, and also due to several accidents near the toll booths, tolls were removed from the road in 1985. The turnpike was renamed for former Governor John Davis Lodge soon afterward. Very few signs nowadays identify the route as one unified road, and the section that runs as Route 695 carries no current identification at all (not even CT 695 markers) except to say that eastbound it goes "To US 6" and westbound it goes "To I-395".

Chehel Sotoun (or 'Chihil Sutun') is a pavilion in Isfahan, Iran. It is in the middle of a park at the end of a long pool. It was built by Shah Abbas II for his entertainment and receptions. In this palace, Shah Abbas II and his successors would receive dignitaries and ambassadors, either on the terrace or in one of the stately reception halls.
The name, meaning "Forty Columns" in Persian, was inspired by the twenty slender wooden columns supporting the entrance pavilion, which, when reflected in the waters of the fountain, are said to appear to be forty.
The palace has many frescoes and paintings on ceramic. Many of the ceramic panels are now in the possession of major museums in the west. They show specific historical scenes. There are also aesthetic compositions in the traditional miniature style which celebrate the joy of life and love.
The Chehel Sotoun Palace is among the nine Iranian Gardens which are registered as one of the Iran’s 17 World Heritage Sites. The nine gardens go by the name of "The Persian Garden".

Gotra

Gotra is a clan in Hindu society. It means the people who are descended in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor. In the 4th century, Pāṇini wrote that gotra are the descendants of a sage, "beginning with the son's son."(IV. 1. 162). A person who says "I am Kashyapa-gotra," can trace his family from the ancient sage Kashyapa through an unbroken male line. 
According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad 2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa, and Atri are seven sages (also known as Saptarishi). The descendants of these eight sages are said to be gotras. This explanation of the eight primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. Descendants of others are called "gotrâvayava".

Adactylidium

Adactylidium is a genus of mites. It is known for its short and unusual life cycle. The pregnant female mite attaches herself to a single egg of a thrip. She grows from five to eight female offspring and one male in her body. The offspring begin to eat their mother from the inside out. The single male mite mates with all his sisters when they are still in the mother. The females, now pregnant, cut holes in their mother's body. This is so that they can get out to find new thrips eggs. The male gets out too. But having served his biological function he dies after a few hours. The females die at the age of four days, when their own offspring eat them alive from the inside.

Louis-Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium (24 July 1833 – 17 May 1834), was the eldest child and heir-apparent of King Leopold I of the Belgians and his second wife, Louise of Orléans. He died as an infant. He may have been named after his grandfather Louis Philippe I. 
Life.
Louis Philippe became crown prince at birth in Laeken. His birth was announced by the sound of 101 cannon shots at the capitol, Brussels. The baby was baptised at the Collegiate church of St. Michael and St. Gudule at Brussels.
Death and burial.
Louis-Philippe died of an inflammation of the mucous membranes. According to his father, this was completely preventable. His funeral was held on 24 May 1843. He was buried in the Mausoleum of the Dukes of Brabant at the Collegiate church of St. Michael and St. Gudule. He is now burried in the chapel of Church of Our Lady of Laeken (Notre Dame de Laeken), near his family's tomb. This church did not exist at the time of his death. His mother died in 1850 and wanted to be buried at Laeken near the royal residence. Construction for the church began in 1854. It houses the royal crypt where the royal family is buried. A contemporary source recorded his passing: "The family of King Leopold are plunged into the deepest distress by the sudden death of the Duke of Brabant, the heir-apparent to the throne." He was followed as crown prince upon the birth of his younger brother, Leopold (Léopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor), who would later succeed their father as Leopold II, King of the Belgians. Leopold was the replacement child to Louis-Philippe.
Titles and Styles.
His tombstone records his titles as: "S.A.R. ("Son Altesse Royale" or Royal Highness) le Prince Louis-Philippe Duc le Brabant".

This page is about the local church group. For the building, see Church. For the worldwide body of Christians, see Christian Church. For For other uses of the word "church", see Church (disambiguation).
A Christian church (or local church) is a group of people who share a faith or belief within a community. They usually meet in one particular location called a cathedral, temple, tabernacle, or simply a church building. A church group represents a certain doctrine and traditions. Many Christian churches that use the same name and share the same beliefs are a part of a denomination. A church that not part of a larger group is usually called nondenominational. There are estimated to be over 41,000 denominations worldwide. They may fall within three general groups: Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant Churches.
In the Bible.
Many Christians believe that churches began on the Day of Pentecost. This is found in the book of Acts in the Bible. The first time the word church is found in the Bible is in Matthew 16:18, when Jesus said, "You are Peter, a rock. This is the rock on which I will put together my church, a church so expansive with energy that not even the gates of hell will be able to keep it out." The Apostle Paul wrote letters to several churches in different cities. These letters later became books of the New Testament.

Horses in World War I were very easily killed by machine guns and ordinary guns on the battlefields. Over 48,000 horses were killed in World War I, 210 from poison gas. Many drowned, died of exhaustion, or got stuck in mud or shell holes.
Horses were mainly used for helping with transport. They carried guns and bullets. They were better than motor vehicles over rough and muddy surfaces. It was hard to get enough food for them because they were in the middle of war. Horses ate about ten times as much food as a human. In 1917, allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced.

CompactFlash

CompactFlash is a name of a standard used for a mass storage device, which is mostly used in digital cameras. Today, most CompactFlah devices use flash memory. Since most CompactFlash cards have no movable parts, they are also used in embedded systems. Compact flash cards are 36.4mm by 42.8mm in size, and either 3.3mm or 5mm thick. The 3.3mm type is known as Type I, the 5mm type is known as Type II. Most type II devices are small hard disks. The transfer speed is often given as an x rating, where the base is 150kB/s for 1x speed, which was also the base speed for reading compact discs.
In many cases, reading is faster than writing, often by a factor of two to three. That way, a speed of "133x" is roughly that of 20MB/sec. When the speed is given as a rate, usually in MB/s, this speed is the maximum speed that can be obtained reading from the device.
There are ComactFlash devices of different capacities.

African palm civet

The African palm civet (Nandinia binotata), or 'two-spotted palm civet', is a small mammal. It is in the Feliformia suborder.
It has short legs, small ears, a body like a civet cat, and a long lithe tail as long as its body. Adults usually weigh 1.70 to. It is native to the forests of eastern Africa and the Congo River basin. It usually lives in trees, and is is omnivorous: it eats rodents, insects, eggs, carrion, fruit, birds and fruit bats. The animal is generally solitary and nocturnal.
Although it looks like other civet species (in the family Viverridae), the African palm civet is genetically distinct: they probably diverged from other civets before the cats did. They are therefore classified as the only species in the genus Nandinia and in their own family, Nandiniidae. However, not all experts accept this.

Often topic sentences do a similar job to summaries.

Bird sound

Bird sounds include bird songs, calls and any other noises they make for communication. Birds do a lot of communicating, mostly to other birds.
Bird song.
Bird songs are for other members of the same species. The functions are partnership, mating and territory ownership. Depending on the species, bird songs may differ for these two rather different functions. In general, bird songs are only used by Passeriformes, the songbirds. It is one of their typical adaptations
Bird song may have evolved through sexual selection. Experiments suggest the quality of bird song may be a good indicator of fitness. Experiments also suggest that parasites and diseases may directly affect song characteristics such as song rate. This also acts as a reliable indicator of health. The song repertoire also appears to indicate fitness in some species. The ability of male birds to hold and advertise territories using song also demonstrates their fitness. 
Heredity.
Usually, the general structure of the song is inherited, and is similar in all members of the species. It may be fine-tuned by the experience of hearing nearby birds of the same species. In some species the song is entirely inherited, and in a few it is entirely learnt.
Song identification.
Many bird songs are so specific that they can be used for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams.
Calls.
Most birds are social animals, and some are always near others of the same species. They use calls which sound quite different to their usual songs. Alarm calls are usually short and loud, and very difficult to locate. They warn others of predators. Mobbing calls gather other birds to scare off intruders. Flocks of birds call to keep themselves together in flight.
Quite a few birds can mimic sounds they have heard. Parrots and drongos are famous for their mimicry. Common drongos in the Kalahari Desert use other birds' alarm calls to scare them off food. They get 23% of their food that way. 
Non-vocal sounds are done by some birds. Woodpeckers drum on hollow trees as a territory marker. Snipes make a sound called "winnowing" or "drumming" with their tail feathers when flying. Storks, which are almost voiceless, clatter their beaks.
Media.
The first person to record bird songs was Ludwig Karl Koch (1881–1974). He made the first known recording in 1889, and later became a BBC broadcaster and sound recordist.

Replacement child

A replacement child is a child conceived by parents to replace an older dead sibling. He or she is usually of the same sex as the child they replaced. Often they are given the same name. The replacement child provides consolation to the parents for the loss of the earlier child. It is also frequently believed they are a reincarnation of the lost child. As a result a replacement child represents the hopes and dreams parents had for the dead child.
History.
The replacement child or replacement child syndrome became popular in periods of high infant mortality. But it continues in modern times in some places. In some religions and cultures, it was bad luck to mention a dead child's name. Even among European royal families, a dead child was often referred to by his or her title and not their name. Among the replacement children of Holocaust the names of the dead were often not spoken of. The name was memorialized in the replacement child (because they were alive the name could be used). 
In early modern Europe the name given a child was supposed to make them like the person they were named for. In many cases the name given a child was an attempt to recreate the lost child (or ancestor). The grief the family felt over the dead child was made better by naming the child after the lost child. This shows a belief that dead spirits were present among the living. In Renaissance Italy the belief was a child was born into the identity given him or her by his family. The modern idea that a person creates their own fate did not exist in earlier times.
Philippe Airès's "L'Enfant et la vie familiale sous 'Ancien Regime" (The Child and Family Life in France before the Revolution), was published in 1960. He believed that before the 18th century the French had no real concept of children. They were seen as adults. They were often dressed like adults. Parents knew many of their children would not survive. For this reason they did not invest in them emotionally. 
The heir and the spare.
In history it has long been a practice for an aristocratic wife to provide an "heir and a spare". That means an heir to continue the family line and a spare in case the heir died too young. In Royal families one spare was the minimum. When child mortality rates were high, more was considered even better to secure the throne. Queen Victoria had nine children. George III had thirteen. These children had different names, but the concept was and is the same. The difference between early heirs and spares and the modern practice is that today a female can inherit the throne.

<doc id="466673" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=466673" title="Bloom filter">
Bloom filter

A Bloom filter is a data structure that allows computers to see if a given element occurs in a set. Bloom filters use hash functions to do this. For each element that is added, a hash value is calculated. When a new element is added, its hash value is compared to that of the other elements in the set. A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure. It is possible to get a false positive, but not to get a false negative. In other words, a query returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed. For each added element, the probability of getting a false positive grows. 
Edward Bloom proposed the Bloom filter in 1970. In the article, Bloom supposes there is an algorithm to hyphenate words at the end of a line. According to the example, most words have simple hyphenation patterns. But about 10% of the words require time-consuming lookups to fetch the correct rule. His case was that of hyphenating about 500,000 words. He saw that using the "normal" error-free hashing techniques, storing the hyphenation patterns, would require a lot of memory. He found that using his technique, he could eliminate most lookups. For example, a hash area only 15% of the size needed by an ideal error-free hash still eliminates 85% of the disk accesses.
More generally, fewer than 10 bits per element are required for a 1% false positive probability, independent of the size or number of elements in the set.

In the 1928–29 NHL season, Bailey became the league leading goal scorer, scoring 22 goals and 32 points in 44 games. He once again became the Maple Leafs' leading scorer in the 1929–30 season and he was one point short of repeating as leading scorer in the 1930–31 season. His offensive production declined in the 1931–32 season but he was still able to help Toronto win the Stanley Cup in 1932.
On December 13, 1933, during a game between the Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins, Bailey was hit from behind by Eddie Shore of Bruins and hit his head on the ice, fracturing his skull. Bailey had severely injured head and it was feared that he would not survive. Bailey would eventually recover from his injury but he was never able to play hockey again. There was an all-star benefit game that was held at Maple Leaf Gardens on February 14, 1934, which raised $20,909.40 for both Bailey and his family. Bailey and Shore shook hands and embraced at centre ice before the start of the game. The NHL introduced the annual all-star game thirteen years later.

Latin poetry

Latin poetry is the poetry of Ancient Rome. They started by adapting Greek models. The verse comedies of Plautus are the earliest surviving examples of Latin literature. They were probably composed around 205–184 BC. 
There was a play written by a Greek slave, Livius Andronicus, at Rome in 240 BC. Livius translated Greek comedy for Roman audiences. He used metres that were those of Greek drama, but modified to the needs of Latin. 
His successors, Plautus and Terence, continued this process. The traditional metre of Greek epic poetry, the dactylic hexameter, was introduced into Latin literature by Ennius (239–169 BC). Ennius provided a model for the later 'classical' poets such as Virgil and Ovid. Horace (who was a contemporary of Virgil) wrote verses in dactylic hexameter. They were in a conversational style, as if writing a letter. Virgil's hexameters are regarded as "the supreme metrical system of Latin literature".

Snowy Mountains

The Snowy Mountains, known informally as "The Snowies", is a region of southeastern Australia and the highest mountain range on the island. It contains the Australian mainland's highest mountain, Mount Kosciuszko, height 2228 m. This is one the five highest peaks in the range, all of which are above 2100 m. 
The Snowy Mountains are in southern New South Wales and are part of the larger Australian Alps and Great Dividing Range. Unusually for Australia, the mountain range have large natural snowfalls every winter. Snow normally falls the most in June, July and early August. Therefore, most of the snow usually melts by late spring. The Tasmanian highlands are the other (major) alpine region in Australia.
The range is host to the mountain plum-pine, a low-lying type of conifer. The region is one of the centres of the Australian ski industry during the winter months: all four snow resorts in New South Wales are in the region.
The Alpine Way and Snowy Mountains Highway are the major roads that go through the Snowy Mountains region.

Hardback

A hardback, hardcover, or hardbound book is one with stiff covers. 
The covers are of rigid cardboard. They are usually covered with cloth or heavy paper. A heavy cloth like buckram, or a leather is sometimes chosen. 
It should have a flexible, sewn spine which allows the book to lie flat on a surface when opened. Less good is a glued spine, because the glue gets worse with time. 
Hardback books may be printed on acid-free paper. They are much more durable than paperbacks. Paperbacks are often printed on cheap recycled paper, and have flexible, easily damaged paper covers. Hardback books are only slightly more costly to make, but are often much more expensive to buy.

Byzantine architecture

Byzantine architecture is the architectural style of the Byzantine Empire. This is a term used by modern historians to mean the Eastern Roman Empire based in Constantinople. The empire lasted for more than a millennium. It left a lasting wikt:influence on Medieval architecture in Europe and the Near East. It also influenced the later Renaissance architecture and Ottoman architecture.
As a distinctive style.
Early Byzantine architecture evolved from Early Christian architecture. The early Christian style typically was a basilica with three or five isles. Usually they had wooden roofs. Vaults and domes were rarely used. Byzantine architecture rarely used three isle or five isle basilicas. In this style domes were frequently used. The Semi-dome was also used, especially over an apse. It reached its highest form with the use of the pendentive. These are usually used to support a dome. The Byzantine pendentive is a geometric form using four triangular legs sitting on a square base. It developed during the 6th century reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. This is when Byzantine architecture became a distinctive style. Windowed domes were also a distinctive feature of this style. The intent was to make the dome look like a crown with jewels of light.
Legacy.
In the West, Byzantine architecture was replaced by Romanesque and Gothic architecture. In Asia it had an influence on early Islamic architecture. Later Ottoman architecture was also influenced by the Byzantine style.

Family Guy (season 1)

The first season of the animated comedy show "Family Guy" premiered on Fox from January 31 to May 16, 1999. The first season of "Family Guy" had seven episodes. The show is about the dysfunctional Griffin family. The family consist of father Peter, mother Lois, daughter Meg, son Chris, baby Stewie, and their anthropomorphic (having human abilities) dog Brian. They all live in their hometown of Quahog, Rhode Island. The show features the voices of the show's creator Seth MacFarlane. Other voice actors include Alex Borstein, Seth Green, and Lacey Chabert. The executive producers for the first season were David Zuckerman and MacFarlane.
The first episode was "Death Has a Shadow". The episode was broadcast after Super Bowl XXXIII and was watched by 22.01 million viewers. The show received positive feedback from critics. The episodes "I Never Met the Dead Man" and "Brian: Portrait of a Dog", received more positive feedback than the rest of the episodes of season one. Some critics did not like the theme of those episodes. The Volume One DVD box set, included all seven episodes and the second season. It was released in Region 1 on April 15, 2003, Region 2 on November 12, 2001, and Region 4 on October 20, 2003. The show has since been released in other television shows. 
MacFarlane first thought of the idea for "Family Guy" in 1995. He was studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). There, he created his thesis movie "The Life of Larry". His professor at RISD submitted the movie to Hanna-Barbera. This gave MacFarlane being hired by the company. Executives at Fox saw the movie. They contracted MacFarlane to create a show based on the characters. They called it "Family Guy". While working on the show, Larry and his dog Steve, became Peter and Brian. The rest of the show's characters were added later.

Brian Spencer

Brian Roy "Spinner" Spencer (September 3, 1949 – June 3, 1988) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger. He played a career total of 10 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Islanders, Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins.
Career.
Spencer was drafted 55th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1969 NHL Amateur Draft. On December 12, 1970, He was called up to play for the Leafs in what would be his first NHL game on television. Spencer phoned his father Roy in British Columbia to tell him to watch the game that night on Hockey Night in Canada. There was an interview with Spencer between periods of the game. However, in British Columbia, instead of the Toronto Maple Leafs/Chicago Black Hawks game being shown, CBC Television aired a game featuring the Vancouver Canucks versus the California Golden Seals instead. Roy was infuriated by this and drove 135 kilometres (84 mi) to Prince George, where the closest CBC Television station, CKPG-TV, is located. When he arrived there, he ordered station staff, at gunpoint, to broadcast the Maple Leafs/Black Hawks game instead. The station did put the game on, but as Roy left the station, he was confronted by the RCMP. After he had a short stand-off with the RCMP, Roy Spencer was shot and killed. He played 95 regular season games with the Maple Leafs and also spent time with their developmental team, the Tulsa Oilers. 
On June 6, 1972, during the 1972 NHL Expansion Draft, Spencer was claimed by the New York Islanders from the Maple Leafs.
He would play 2 seasons with the Islanders before he was traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Doug Rombough on March 10, 1974. During his time with the Sabres, he had his best offensive production. He was able to record 12 goals and 29 assists in the 1974–75 season. He was a fan favourite in Buffalo, fans loved his hustle, aggressive play, and hitting ability.
On September 20, 1977, the Sabres traded Spencer to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Ron Schock. During his time with the Penguins, his offensive play declined drastically. His last seasons in the NHL came in 1978-79. He was sent down to the AHL to play for the Binghamton Dusters, Springfield Indians, and Hershey Bears and then he retired in 1980.
Death.
After Spencer retired from hockey, he struggled with a life of drugs and violence. In 1987, he was charged murder and kidnapping and he faced the death penalty. Former Sabres teammate Rick Martin testified as a character witness at the trial. In March 1988, a not guilty verdict was returned by the jury and Spencer vowed to change his life around. 
Even though he was acquitted, his life still continued to spiral out of control and on June 3, 1988, Spencer was shot and killed at gunpoint in a robbery following a crack cocaine purchase in Riviera Beach, Florida. Two men were charged in his murder. Larry Willie Johnson was sentenced to 40 years in prison and Leon Daniels was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
He was survived by five children from two marriages, and his twin brother, Byron. A book about Spencer's life called "Gross Misconduct: The Life of Spinner Spencer", was written by Martin O'Malley. The book was later adapted into a made-for-television movie in Canada called Gross Misconduct by Atom Egoyan.

Semi-dome

A semi-dome(also called a "half-dome") is the term in architecture for half a dome. It is used to cover a semi-circular area, usually an apse. A semi-dome was often used at each end of a barrel vaulted ceiling. 
History.
An early use was to cover Roman cult images. They are a feature found in Ancient Roman and traditional church architecture. The semi-dome is featured in Byzantine architecture and Early Christian architecture. They are prominent in mosques and iwans in Islamic architecture. Some mosques featured semi-domes decorated with glass mosaics. In the second half of the 6th century Ottoman architecture began using half-domes combined with domes. Semi-domes were common in Roman baths, palaces and large buildings. During the Dark Ages in Britain whenever an apse was built, a semi-dome covered it. In 11th century Normandy every apse of every church had a semi-dome over it. The semi-dome went out of use when the east end of churches were squared.

Aspergillus flavus

Aspergillus flavus is a potentially dangerous pathogen. It is a fungus with a very widespread distribution. It grows in soils as a saprophyte. It also grows on cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts. 
In addition to causing pre-harvest and post-harvest infections, many strains produce toxic compounds known as mycotoxins. If eaten, they are toxic to mammals. The toxin produced by this species is called 'aflotoxin'.
"A. flavus" is a human and animal pathogen. In mammals, the pathogen can cause liver cancer if contaminated food is eaten. It also causes aspergillosis (invasive growth) in people whose immune system is damaged. 
How deadly is it?
In 1960 on an English farm, about 100,000 turkeys died. The cause of death was the primary food source, peanut meal. It was infected with "A. flavus". The culture was isolated, grown in pure culture, and a subset of healthy turkeys was infected. The pure culture isolate causes death in the healthy turkeys. There were four toxic chemicals (aflatoxins). 
Turkey autopsies showed aflatoxins targeted the liver and either completely killed the tissue cells or induced tumor formation. New standards for the production of food for human consumption were developed, which led to increases in cost. 
Crop management.
To keep grains and legumes remain free of "A. flavus" infection, some things must be done before, during, and after harvest. Moisture levels should be kept below 11.5%. Temperature in storage units should be kept as low as possible: the pathogen cannot grow below 5°C. The low temperature slows respiration and reduces moisture. 
Fumigation reduces insects and mites, otherwise they help the spread of the pathogen. Removing old, unripe, damaged and broken seeds, and cleanliness also keeps down the spread of the pathogen.
Biological control.
Yeast.
To protect tree nuts and corn plants that are affected by "A. flavus" treating the plants with the yeast "Pichia anomala" reduces the growth of "A. flavus". Treating pistachio trees with "P. anomala" inhibited the growth of "A. flavus" up to 97% when compared to untreated trees. The yeast successfully competes with "A. flavus" for space and nutrients, ultimately limiting the growth of "A. flavus". 
"A.flavus" AF36.
The good news is that there is a non-harmful strain which outcompetes the pathogenic strains.
"Aspergillus flavus" strain AF36 is not carcinogenic and is toxin-free. It is used as an active ingredient in pesticides. AF36 is a fungal antagonist and is applied as a commercial biocontrol to cotton and corn to reduce aflatoxin exposure. AF36 is grown on sterile seeds which serve as the carrier and a source of nutrients. After application and colonization, AF36 growing seeds will out-compete aflatoxin-producing strains of "A. flavus". Non-aflatoxin spore dispersal is aided by wind and insects.

Sir Alan Hodgkin, OM, KBE, PRS (Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, 5 February 1914 – 20 December 1998) was an English physiologist and biophysicist. He shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Andrew Huxley and John Eccles.
Alan Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley, and John Eccles (for his research on synapses) were jointly awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane". In addition Hodgkin and Huxley's findings led them to suggest the existence of ion channels in cell membranes, which was confirmed decades later.
Hodgkin was knighted (KBE) in 1972 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1973. From 1970 to 1975 he was President of the Royal Society.

2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa

The 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa were shootings that took place on October 22, 2014 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. A gunman shot and killed a Canadian Army soldier, Nathan Cirillo, who was on ceremonial guard duty just outside the Canadian National War Memorial. Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the shootings a "terrorist attack."
Shootings.
Earlier, witnesses saw a man dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket with a head scarf arrive at the National War Memorial in a car, carrying a double-barreled shotgun. The man fired two shots and fatally wounded Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian Army reservist soldier, who was standing guard at the Memorial. After the gunman shot Cirillo, he carjacked a vehicle and drove 600 meters to Parliament Hill. Cirillo was later rushed to the hospital where he was reported dead.
The gunman entered the Canadian Parliament buildings through the Centre Block just under the Peace Tower and shot a security guard in the leg. There were then around 20 and 30 gunshots exchanged between the gunman and security. The gunman ran down the Hall of Honor to the entrance of the Library, which is beside the office of Kevin Vickers, the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Canadian House of Commons. Vickers grabbed his handgun and went into the hall. He dropped to the ground and shot three times. The gunman was engaged by six officers. One of the shots fired by Constable Curtis Barrett hit the gunman in the head and killed him. 
Prime Minister Stephen Harper and New Democratic Party Leader Thomas Mulcair were both holding caucus meetings in rooms that were on both sides of the shooter's path. The Prime Minister and some of the MPs were escorted out of the building while some of the others had barricaded themselves behind doors.
The gunman was later identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian man, who had a criminal record and had recently converted to Islam. His passport had been seized by the Canadian government because he had been labeled as a 'high-risk traveller'.

The contras is the name given to the rebel groups that were active from 1979 through to the early 1990s. They were against the Sandinista Junta of National Reconstruction government in Nicaragua. Among the separate contra groups, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) emerged as the largest by far. In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the Nicaraguan Resistance.
From an early stage, the rebels received financial and military support from the U.S. government. President Ronald Reagan supported the group. After the U.S. support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration secretly gave them money from profit they gained after selling weapons to Iran. These secret activities soon became known as the Iran–Contra affair.

Foundation (engineering)

A foundation is the lowest part of a building. A building needs a strong foundation if it is to stand for a long time.
To make a foundation, engineers dig a trench in the ground. They dig until they reach solid ground. When the trench is deep enough, it is filled it with strong, hard material. Sometimes concrete is used. Concrete can be made stronger by putting long thin round pieces of steel into the trench. When the concrete dries, the steel ties the foundation together. We call this reinforced concrete. Once the foundation has been packed down tightly, or dried hard, construction can start.

A foundation is a kind of company set up to carry out charity or research work. A foundation is usually endowed, which means it is given a large sum of money to do its work. An example is the Rockefeller Foundation. The Rockefeller family made their money from banking and oil and their family foundation is endowed with a very great sum of money. The people running the foundation think of ways to use the money to help charities, the arts, or whatever they like.
Another example is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill Gates made a fortune from Microsoft. He and his wife now spend nearly all their time giving away the money he has made. They give it to projects like education in the United States and treating AIDS in Third World countries.

Habit (biology)

Habit in biology is about the shape and/or behaviour of plants and animals.
Botany.
The way plants grow makes their shape of habit. This is the way we can tell trees apart even at a distance. The shape of a willow tree or a poplar is very distinct. It is made during growth. Bacteria and fungi also have very distinct types of growth.
Trees are also examples of a life style when compared to shrubs and annual plants. To be a tree is to occupy a different space in the ecosystem from shrubs or climbers.
Zoology.
In zoology, "habit" often refers to a specific behaviour of a species. For example:
The 'mode of life' (or 'lifestyle') is sometimes referred to as the 'habit of an animal. Terms like motile or sessile, sedentary, free-living, parasitic, saprophyte, terrestrial, arboreal, aquatic, pelagic, diurnal, nocturnal, are all modes of life or habits.

Apalachee people

The Apalachee were a Native American people who historically lived in the Florida Panhandle. 
History.
The Apalachee occupied the site of Velda Mound starting about 1450 CE. They had left the area before the Spanish came in the 17th century. They first saw Spanish explorers in the 16th century. This is when the Hernando de Soto expedition arrived. They lived between the Aucilla River and Ochlockonee River, at the head of Apalachee Bay. This was an area known to Europeans as the Apalachee Province. 
The Spaniards had created Catholic missions throughout their province by the early 1600s. The Apalachee were farmers and noted warriors. By 1655 there were eight towns, each with a mission. In addition to the Spanish, each town had an Apalachee population of between 6,000–8000. The British with their Creek allies often raided the Apalachee and Spanish towns. In 1703 a British army and hundreds of Creek warriors attacked the territory. The Apalachee were nearly destroyed. The survivors, who numbered about 1400, dispersed. Over time many Apalachee mixed in with other groups, particularly the Creek Confederacy. Others found protection with the French in what is now Alabama and Louisanna. About 300 descendants in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, claim an Apalachee identity today.
Language.
The Apalachee spoke a Muskogean language called Apalachee. The language is now extinct.

Caltrop

Caltrops are spiked weapons against men and horses since at least Roman times. They are a type of anti-personnel weapon. Japanese samurai used a similar weapon, the makibishi.
Iron caltrops were used as early as 331 BC at Gaugamela. They were known to the Romans as "tribulus", meaning 'jagged iron'. They were used in the Battle of Carrhae in 51 BC.
The Roman writer Vegetius, discussed scythed chariots in his "De Re Militari":
Error: No text given for quotation (or equals sign used in the actual argument to an unnamed parameter)
In more modern times, they were used by both the Allies and Axis during World War II to puncture the tires of wheeled vehicles. Improvised caltrops, usually made of welded nails, have also been used occasionally by labor activists in the United States during strikes to destroy the tires of vehicles belonging to management and replacement workers. In the labor context, these devices are more often called jack rocks. A recent example of the use of jack rocks in labor disputes was in 2012, allegedly by two men on a picket line at an aluminum products plant in West Virginia.

English lyrics.
<poem>
Serene and happy, brave and daring,
Let us sing, soldiers, the battle hymn.
Our voices shall astonish the world
Which will see on us the children of the Cid.
Soldiers, the country calls us to the fight.
Let us swear for her to succeed or to die.
Never saw the world more noble daring,
Nor any day greater valor was shown,
Than that, inflamed, we showed at the fire
Awaken in Riego the love of his land.
Soldiers, the country calls us to the fight.
Let us swear for her to conquer or to die.
The war trumpet echoes to the winds;
Affrighting the greedy, the cannon now roars.
at Mars, wrathful provokes the audacity
And the ingenuity of our nation.
Soldiers, the country calls us to the fight.
Let us swear for her to succeed or to die.

Meaning

Meaning is a term in linguistics and philosophy. It is also a word in everyday life. The basic idea is this: meaning is the information which is sent by speech or messages. What that information is can be inferred by a listener or reader.
Meaning makes sense as part of a conversation between two or more people. The bits of a conversation, like questions and answers, suggestions and explanations, work to help the meaning get across. Requests and instructions are other types of communication which depend on meaning.
Although humans use language to carry meaning, non-verbal communication definitely has meaning. In fact it is far more ancient than human language, and interpreting its meaning is mostly done by the unconscious mind. Messages travel by scent and sight as well as sound. Humans do some of this as well as almost all animals. In humans, facial expressions and the sense of touch are very important. All these things have meaning.

Korat

The Korat is a natural breed of cat. It is also one of the oldest cat breeds. It first lived in Thailand. It is named after a province named "Korat" by the local people. The Korat is known as one of the "good luck cats".
Appearance.
The Korat is a blue-gray colour with a small to medium stocky or "cobby" body. It can be surprisingly heavy for its size. It is intelligent, active, playful and likes to be with people. It has a heart-shaped head and large green eyes.
The Korat's colour is actually a silver blue that looks like it is shimmering. The people of Thailand call the colour "rain-cloud gray," and the shimmer "sea foam." This cat has one coat of fur that is short. The roots of the fur are a lighter silver blue. The colour along the fur increases to deeper blue and the tips are silver, especially on the muzzle and toes. This is the only colour allowed for a Korat. The eyes are large and peridot green in an adult cat. Kittens have amber or golden-green eyes which gradually change as they become adults, at two to four years. 
Korats may rarely have some white markings or spots, or even pale gray stripes. Sometimes these spots increase in size as the cat gets older. These are flaws in the colour, and these cats are not allowed in cat shows. Even though the colour is wrong, they are still healthy cats. 
History.
The first time the Korat breed was written about in books was in a poem written in Thailand, between 1350 and 1767 AD. The book is now in the national library in Bangkok. But the drawing of the Korat in this book did not have enough detail to positively say it is this breed. In more recent years, the Korat was pictured on a postage stamp in Thailand. 
A Korat cat first appeared in Britain with the name "Blue Siamese" in 1889 and 1896. But these solid blue cats did not meet the cat show standards for a Siamese cat, so they disappeared by 1901. 
In the United States, a Korat first appeared in the 1950s. In 1959, Cedar Glen cattery was the first to import a pair of Korats to the U.S. for breeding. They were a male named Nara and a female named Darra. In 1966, the Korat was first allowed to be shown for championship status, by a breeder from Maryland.

Tagbilaran

Tagbilaran is the capital and main city of the Bohol province, in the Bohol island, Philippines. Because of the Tagbilaran Airport, the city is an important way for tourists to start trips through the rest of the island and neigboring islands.
The inhabitants of this city are known as "tagbilaranons".
History.
In 1565, a Spanish explorer named Miguel López de Legazpi came to Bohol looking for spices and gold. He made a peace pact with Datu Sikatuna in a place called Bool, now a district of Tagbilaran. This pact was signed with a blood pact between the two men.
On 9 February 1742, the Governor of the Visayas Francisco Antonio Calderon de la Barca separated Tagbilaran from Baclayon and made it a town with the name of "San Jose de Tagbilaran" and dedicated to St. Joseph the Worker. Since then, it was part of the province of Bohol and became officially a component city (a city that is part of a province) on 1 July 1966 by the Republic Act No. 4660.
Geography.
Tagbilaran is in the southwestern part of the island of Bohol, in front of the smaller island of Panglao; between the two islands is the Tagbilaran Strait.
The city is 630 km southeast of the national capital of Manila and 72 km south of the regional capital, Cebu City.
It has a total area of 36.50 km2, but the total land area, without the parts that are in the sea, is 32.70 km2. The coastline is about 13 km long.
There is a ridge (a long and narrow chain of small hills) with an average altitude of 30 m that runs parallel to the coastline; at both ends of the ridge there are two hills: "Elley Hill" (100 m) in the north and "Banat-I Hill" (145 m) in the south.
Tagbilaran borders with the municipalities of Cortes (north), Corella (northeast) and Baclayon (east). To the south is the "Tagbilaran Strait" and the Panglao island, and to the west is the "Maribojoc Bay" (part of the Cebu Strait).
With a population of 96,792, Tagbilaran has a population density of 2960.0 /km2 inhabitants/km2.
Climate.
Tagbilaran has, like the rest of the Philippines, a tropical climate. The average temperature is high and the humidity is also high. The dry and the wet seasons are very similar.
Administrative divisions.
The city of Tagbilaran is divided into 15 barangays (like neighbourhoods).

Panglao Island

Panglao is a small island in the north Bohol Sea, in the Central Visayas Region of the Visayas island group, in the south-central Philippines.
The island is an important touristic place because of the beaches found here and the presence of coral reefs near the island.
Geography.
The island of Panglao has an area of 91.12 km2. The island had a population, as of 2010, of 68,051, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.
The island is in the northern part of the Bohol Sea (or "Mindanao Sea"), to the southwest of the island of Bohol and to the east of the island of Cebu. Panglao is separated from the Bohol island by a narrow strait, the Tagbilaran Strait, and two bridges connect the island with the city of Tagbilaran.
There are several smaller islands close to Panglao, such as Gak-ang, Pontod, and Balicasag.
Panglao has a terrain that range from plain, hilly to mountainous, composed by a limestone that is soluble and that causes the formation of caves and sinkholes. One interesting geological feature of the island is the "Hinagdanan Cave" which has an underground water source; because there no rivers or lakes in the island, the cave is an important water source.
Biodiversity.
During the works of the Panglao Marine Biodiversity Project, about 250 new species of crustaceans and 1,500-2,500 new species of mollusks were found in the waters of Panglao and Balicasag. The project found that Panglao alone has more marine biodiversity than Japan and the Mediterranean sea.
Because of this biodiversity, the island was proposed in 2006 as a World Heritage Site by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines.
Administrative divisions.
The island of Panglao is within the Bohol province, and is divided into 2 municipalties and 22 barangays (like neighbourhoods).

The Battle of the Kasserine Pass was a battle fought in Tunisia. It was part of the Tunisia Campaign. The battle took place from 19 February 1943 to 24 February 1943. 
The Axis forces were commanded by Erwin Rommel. They were mostly made from the Afrika Korps and The Italian Centauro Armoured Division. They also included some divisions from the German 5th Panzer Army. The Americans and the II Corps of the U.S Army were led by Lloyd Fredendall. The British 1st Army was led by Kenneth Anderson. 
This battle is remembered for being the first major battle between the Americans and Germans in World War Two. 
It was the first battle in which the Americans soldiers fought an enemy with better organization and experienced soldiers. The battle at the beginning was very costly for the Americans. They were forced to retreat 50 mi from their starting position at the Faid Pass. The Americans were soon reinforced with both American and British reinforcements. They forced Rommel to retreat to better positions. 
This battle caused a change in American military organization, to better prepare the army for the war in North Africa. When Rommel and the Americans fought again weeks later, the American improvements were seen in battle.

Hotline Miami

Hotline Miami is a violent 2D top-down shooter indie video game. The game was inspired by the 2011 film Drive and the 2006 film Cocaine Cowboys. 
Development.
The developers said that they "wanted it to be disturbing and we wanted people to feel the violence". They made the graphics pixel art to make sure the game was not controversial. A developer, Jonatan Söderström started making a game called Super Carnage, which was very similar to Hotline Miami. The aim of the game was to kill as many people as possible. The game was left unfinished because of difficulties coding the AI. 
Before starting development, the developers wanted inspiration, so they watched some movies like Kick-Ass, Drive and Cocaine Cowboys. They wanted to raise questions about what it meant to kill a virtual person in a video game. Mid-way through development, Söderström worried that he was running out of money, so he started Hotline Miami. They spent 9 months in an apartment coding the game. Dennis Wedin said this about the development of the game: "It was fucking hard...". 
Söderström said that he created Hotline Miami with Games Maker, because it let him make the game fast. He also said that it doesn't need that much programming knowledge to use. He said it was a lot slower than other engines, and is quite limited. They had some problems with Games Maker, because they were using an old version. Weldin claimed he liked games that were just games, but Söderström wanted the player to think about the game's meaning. 
The developers said that the AI was the hardest thing to create in the game.
Story and Gameplay.
The player controls an un-named hero (who fans call Jacket), who's gradually losing his mind. The objective of each level is to kill all enemies in the room, and go to the next one. After every job, the player goes to the same store to order a pizza. The player then return to your safehouse.
Masks.
There are unlockable masks in Hotline Miami, each have their own abilities.
Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number.

Diastase

Diastases are a group of enzymes which break down starch into the sugar maltose. Diastase was the first enzyme discovered. It was got from malt solution in 1833 by Anselme Payen and Jean-François Persoz, chemists at a French sugar factory. 
The name "diastase" comes from the Greek word διάστασις (diastasis). It means a parting or separation. The enzymes simply split the starch molecule. Today, diastase means any α-, β-, or γ-amylase that can break down carbohydrates.
The commonly used -ase suffix for naming enzymes was derived from the name diastase. The breakdown of starches follows a general diastase-catalysed reaction:
A–B + H2O → A–OH + B–H

Ontario Highway 401

 
Ontario Highway 401, also called King's Highway 401, is a provincial highway in southern Ontario, Canada. It is 817.9 kilometres (508.2 miles) long. It starts near Ontario's border with Quebec, where the road is called Quebec Autoroute 20. The part of the highway as it passes through Toronto is one of the busiest highways in the world. The western end of the highway is in Windsor.
Construction on the highway started in 1947. By 1952, three differant parts of the highway were finished, with the three parts connected by 1964. In 2013, another part of the highway was started. This part would extend the highway to the New International Trade Crossing at the Canadian-U.S. border near Detroit.
In 2008, part of the highway between Trenton and Toronto was called the "Highway of Heroes". This was because many Canadian soldiers who were killed overseas arrived at the Trenton airforce base. Their bodies were then transported along the highway to Toronto.

Lubrication

Lubrication is a physical process which allows surfaces to move smoothly against each other. A thin film of lubricant put between the surfaces reduces friction and wear on the surfaces, and keeps temperatures from rising too far. The lubricant film can be a solid/liquid dispersion, a liquid, a liquid-liquid dispersion (a grease) or, exceptionally, a solid or gas.
Examples are the use of oil in machinery, the function of tears in eyes and synovial fluid in joints.

The House of Beauvau was a noble family that originated from Anjou a region of France. The Beauvau du Rivau branch was rooted in Brittany. It produced two bishops of Nantes. The Craon (Prince of Craon) branch was established in Lorraine. This branch was intimate with the then reigning ducal family.
Brief history.
Of knightly extraction, it has proofs of its nobility going back as far as 1265. The title of marquis of Beauvau was granted to the head of the family by Louis XIV in 1664. The family also had rights to the prestigious title of "cousin du Roi", reserved for a few families with an alliance with the royal house. Marc de Beauvau, Prince of Craon (1679–1754) was entitled prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1722, and it was under this title that the family was admitted to the "honneurs de la Cour" in 1775.
Princes of Craon.
The princely title of Prince of Craon was a title used by the Beauvau family using their status as Prince of the Holy Roman Empire which was gained in 1722. This was later fully recognised by Louis XV of France in 1755. The title was inherited by male offspring. It became extinct in 1982. These princes were sometimes but also known as the Prince of Beauvau.
In Lorraine.
The Beauvau family later enjoyed close relations with the then ducal family of Lorraine even going so far as to name one of their sons after a son of the Duke. They had a townhouse in Nancy, itself the capital of Lorraine. The townhouse was called the "Hôtel de Craon". The family also had a residence in Paris named the "Hôtel de Beauvau".

Atlanta Campaign

The Atlanta Campaign (6 May 1864 – 2 September 1864) was a series of battles during the American Civil War. The campaign was planned and executed by the Union Army under Major general William T. Sherman. The first part of the plan was to defeat the Confederate Army of Tennessee led by General Joseph E. Johnston. The second goal was to take the important city of Atlanta. Sherman captured Atlanta but was unable to completely destroy the Army of Tennessee.
Background.
The war had been going on for three years when Ulysses S. Grant was given command of the Union Army. While a much smaller army, the Confederates had been moving their forces to battle whichever Union army was active at the time. By doing this they had won most of the battles. Grant decided to coordinate his armies and defeat the confederates. His field armies would all engage the confederate field armies at the same time. This would pin down the smaller southern armies so the Union army could defeat them. Grant would personally lead the Army of the Potomac against Confederate general General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia. He would try to capture the capital of the confederacy, Richmond. Sherman would move his army against Johnston and capture the South's second largest city, Atlanta. If successful, it would shorten the war and get President Abraham Lincoln reelected that November. If they failed, Lincoln would lose the election and the southern states might break away permanently.
The campaign.
By 1864 the Confederacy knew they couldn't defeat the stronger Union army. But they could win the war by simply not losing to the North. They would keep fighting until the Union got tired of war and asked for peace. Lee had to defend Richmond and keep the Union army away. Johnston had to defend Atlanta and keep their supply lines open.
Sherman had over 100,000 men he divided into three field armies. Johnston had 53,800 men. At the last minute he received another 15,000 men making his the larger of the two main Southern armies. But it was still only about half the size of the Union army facing him. In the opening weeks of the campaign Sherman forced Johnston's confederates back from one place to another. Repeatedly Sherman moved two of his field armies against Johnston while a third army under James B. McPherson threatened the supply lines. McPherson's army was also used in flanking maneuvers. Sherman's combined armies kept moving towards Atlanta while Johnston's armies fell back. Finally Johnston retreated into Atlanta on July 9–10. Jefferson Davis the Confederate president, dismissed Johnston for not stopping the Union army. He gave command to John B. Hood, Johnston's second in command. Hood had little chance of succeeding. Sherman's army was five miles from the city when Hood took command.
Siege of Atlanta.
Hood ordered his men to attack Sherman's army on July 20. The attempts failed and by July 22 Hood had lost 8,000 men to Sherman's losses of about 3,000. Hood retreated back into Atlanta again. Sherman set up his cannon and began a bombardment of Atlanta that would last a month. Then Sherman withdrew his armies leaving only a small force. Hood's army followed them to Jonesboro, Georgia. Sherman's army cut Hoods line of retreat back to Atlanta. The Battle of Jonesborough lasted two days and ended on 1 September. After taking heavy casualties what was left of Hood's army burned their supplies and ammunition and left Atlanta. Sherman then took Atlanta. This was a major loss for the confederacy. It almost guaranteed Lincoln's reelection. It also led to the next campaign, Sherman's March to the Sea.

Climbing plant

Climbing plants are plants which climb up trees and other tall objects. Many of them are vines whose stems twine round trees and branches. There are quite a number of other methods of climbing.
The climbing habit has evolved many times. It is a key innovation which has been very successful.
Over 130 plant families include climbers. Vine species may represent more than 40% of species diversity in tropical forests.
Investigation showed that in most cases the climbing species were more diverse (had more species) than their non–climbing sister groups.
It has evolved independently in several plant families, using many different climbing methods: 
The climbing fetterbush ("Pieris phillyreifolia") has a strange habit. It is a woody shrub-vine which climbs without clinging roots, tendrils, or thorns. Its stem goes into a crack in the bark of fibrous barked trees (such as bald cypress). The stem flattens and grows up the tree "underneath" the host tree's outer bark. The fetterbush then sends out branches that emerge near the top of the tree.
Most vines are flowering plants. These may be divided into woody vines or lianas, such as wisteria, kiwifruit, and common ivy, and herbaceous (nonwoody) vines, such as morning glory.
One odd group of climbing plants is the fern genus "Lygodium", called "climbing ferns". The stem does not climb, but rather the fronds (leaves) do. The fronds unroll from the tip, and theoretically never stop growing; they can form thickets as they unroll over other plants, rock faces, and fences.

Flanking maneuver

In military tactics, a flanking maneuver (also called a flank attack), is an attack on the sides or rear of an opposing force. If a flanking maneuver succeeds, the opposing force would be surrounded from two or more directions. This reduces the ability of the outflanked force to move or defend itself. A psychological advantage may also be present. The confusion and threat from multiple directions can often cause shock and panic. This may cause soldiers to run from the battle. A larger-scaled tactical flanking is called a strategic flanking. This is where the targets of the flanking could be as large as divisions or even entire armies.
Strategy.
A flanking maneuver works best when an enemy is engaged at their front. Often an opposing force must be maneuvered into a position where a flanking attack would work. An ideal situation is getting them into a position where their front is narrow and the flanks are long.

Lincoln Center

Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is a 16.3 acre complex of buildings. It is located in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Jed Bernstein began as president in 2014.
History and facilities.
A group of civic leaders led by John D. Rockefeller III built Lincoln Center. It was part of the "Lincoln Square Renewal Project" during Robert Moses's program of urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. Respected architects were contracted to design the major buildings on the site. Over the next thirty years the area around Lincoln Center became a new cultural hub.
Rockefeller was Lincoln Center's first president in 1956. He became its chairman in 1961. Rockefeller is credited with raising more than half of the $184.5 million in private funds needed to build the complex. The center's three buildings, Avery Fisher Hall (formerly Philharmonic Hall), David H. Koch Theater (formerly the New York State Theater) and the Metropolitan Opera House were opened in 1962, 1964 and 1966, respectively.
The center may have been named because it was located in the Lincoln Square neighborhood. It is unclear whether the area was named as a tribute to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. The name was bestowed on the area in 1906 by the New York City Board of Aldermen. The records give no reason for choosing that name.

The Battle of Crete was a battle fought in World War 2 between the Nazis and British soldiers with Greek support. It was fought from 20 May to 1 June 1941. The battle began in the morning of 20 May when German paratroopers, began Operation Mercury. The battle was fought on the Greek island of Crete.
On the first day of fighting, the German paratroopers suffered heavy losses due to large amounts of Anti-Air guns, and Allied soldiers, but the British confident that they would destroy the German invasion. But miscommunication and bad decisions, the Germans were able to capture Malene airfield on West Crete, allowing them to transport supplies and reinforcements to Crete, and destroy the Allied forces defending the island.
This battle was the first time Hitler used paratroopers on a massive scale, Also being the first massive airborne invasion on Military history, and the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from the German Enigma code, also the first time when German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population.

Perennial stream

A perennial stream or perennial river is a stream or river (channel) which always flows in some parts all year round during years of normal rainfall. Perennial streams are different to intermittent streams; which normally stop flowing for weeks or months each year. They are also different to ephemeral streams that flow only for hours or days after rainfall. During unusually dry years a perennial stream may stop flowing. In a drought, they may not flow for months. The differences between perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams are not exact and can change if different measures are used by different groups.
In dry weather it may not be possible to see the water flowing, or see any water at all. In streams with gravel or rock) bottoms, the water may be flowing beneath or between the rocks. In biology, a stream is flowing if there is enough water to support aquatic life, including fish and gill-breathing amphibians, benthic insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. These can live in a shallow flow beneath rocks or logs. The flow may be so small that it can not be measured by stream flow measurement instruments.

Aneuploidy

Aneuploidy is a condition where the nucleus of a cell has one or a few chromosomes more or less than the usual number in the species. It is a common cause of genetic disorders. Aneuploidy occurs during cell division when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells. 
Aneuploidy often causes birth defects and miscarriages. Birth defects make up about 3% of births in the United States. Among those who survive birth, Down syndrome is the most common form of aneuploidy. Many with Down syndrome do survive to adulthood. Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes. The aneuploid theory of cancer suggests that aneuploidy is a cause of cancer rather than a result of it.

"Tardar Sauce" redirects here. For the sauce, see Tartar sauce.
Grumpy Cat is a famous cat on the internet. Her real name is Tardar Sauce. She became popular because she always looks unhappy or "grumpy".
Her owner says that her grumpy-looking face is due to feline dwarfism and the placement of her teeth in her mouth.
History.

She was born on April 4, 2012, with "a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail". Her mom is a calico short haired cat and her father has grey and white stripes. Tardar Sauce is small for her breed and has hind legs that "are a bit different". Even though she has a grumpy expression all the time, she is calm and "actually really nice". Her brother, Pokey, who was born in the same litter, has the grumpy personality.
Her owners say Tardar Sauce is a normal cat "99% of the time". She is only allowed to have photos taken once a week. She cannot be handled by people she does not know very often.
Popularity.
Grumpy Cat first became famous when Tabatha's brother posted some photos of her on Reddit, the social-news site. Then, other users made photoshopped parodies of the unhappy cat with grumpy sayings, such as: "‘I had fun once. It was awful’" and "‘Just put me down’".
Grumpy Cat has her own website. She has a Facebook page. She has a manager, Ben Lashes. He also represents Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat. There are stuffed toy cats of her, t-shirts, calendars and mugs available for sale in stores and online. Many are featured on her website.

They gave her a private hotel room with a king-sized bed, a personal assistant, a chauffeur, and all the Friskies food and bottled water she wanted. 
On March 22, 2013, Grumpy Cat traveled to New York City to promote the Friskies game show. She appeared on "Good Morning America" and "Anderson Live" with Anderson Cooper.

James B. McPherson

James Birdseye McPherson (November 14, 1828 – July 22, 1864) was a Union Army major general during the American Civil War. He was killed at the Battle of Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign. 
Early life.
McPherson was born in 1828 near Clyde, Ohio. He was the eldest son of William and Cynthia (Russell) McPherson who were farmers. To help his family, in 1841 at age 12, McPherson entered an apprenticeship at a general store. He became a clerk for Robert Smith. McPherson was raised and tutored along with Smith's children. His father died in 1847 and Smith paid for McPherson's education at Norwalk Academy. In 1849 Smith arranged an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. McPherson spent much of his time tutoring his John Bell Hood. McPherson graduated in 1853, first in his class.
Military career.
He secured a posting as a second lieutenant with the United States Army Corps of Engineers. He worked on improvements to New York Harbor. He was assigned to the building of Fort Delaware. McPherson then directed worked on fortifications on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. In 1858 he was a first lieutenant. In 1861 when the Civil war broke out, he raised a company of volunteers to fight for the Union. Now a captain went to Boston to supervise the construction of harbor defenses. His former commander helped him by making McPherson his Aide-de-camp and promoted him to Lieutenant colonel. 
In early 1861 McPherson was assigned to the staff of general Ulysses S. Grant as an engineering officer. In 1862 he impressed his superiors and was assigned to supervise military railroads in Mississippi. In this position he was a brigadier general of volunteers. After the Battle of Corinth McPherson was promoted to the rank of major general (8 October 1862). He became commander of Seventeenth Corps in the Army of the Tennessee. At the Battle of Raymond a small force of Confederates attacked his 10,000 man column. They were almost completely destroyed before they realized their mistake. He commanded his corps at the Siege of Vicksburg. 
In January of 1864 he succeeded general Sherman as commander of the Army of the Tennessee. As part of Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, on several occasions his army threatened the enemy's supply lines. McPherson's army was also used in flanking maneuvers. Sherman's combined armies kept moving towards Atlanta while the confederate armies, under Joseph E. Johnston, fell back. Finally Johnston retreated into Atlanta on July 9–10. Jefferson Davis the Confederate president, dismissed Johnston for not stopping the Union army. Davis gave command to general John B. Hood, McPherson's friend and former roommate. Hood had little chance of succeeding. Sherman's larger army, including McPherson's Army of the Tennessee, was five miles from the city when Hood took command.
His death.
On learning of Johnson's replacement by Hood, and knowing Hood as well as he did, McPherson readied his army for an attack by Hood's confederates. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee was holding Sherman's left flank. On 22 July 1864, Hood directed his attack against McPherson's army. The battle went on for several hours. During a break in the fighting McPherson saw a gap developing in the Union lines. He rode out with a staff officer to close the gap. He came upon confederate skirmishers who ordered him to surrender. He turned and spurred his horse to escape, but was shot and killed. His body was returned to the Union lines for burial. Both Sherman and Hood mourned his death. McPherson was the second highest ranking Union officer killed in the civil war. He was buried in his hometown of Clyde, Ohio. Five years after his death President Rutherford B. Hayes presided over a ceremony where a bronze statue was placed over his grave.

Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin

Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin, or Levantine art, is a group of over 750 prehistoric sites. They were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998. 
The sites are in the eastern part of Spain. They show rock art from the Upper Paleolithic or (more likely) Mesolithic periods of the Stone Age. 
The art is small painted figures of humans and animals. The earliest phases are of animals only. They are the most advanced and widespread examples from this period, certainly in Europe. It is notable for the number of places included, the largest concentration of such art in Europe. Its name refers to the Mediterranean Basin. However, while some sites are near the sea, many of them are inland in Aragon and Castile-La Mancha. "Levantine Art" here means "from Eastern Spain", not the Levant region).

Dijon mustard

Dijon mustard is a kind of culinary mustard that was first prepared around the town of Dijon, in eastern France. Dijon mustard was first prepared in the 18th century. 
Properly, it is made from the seeds of "Brassica nigra" (black mustard), but commercially brown mustard is often used. In the original recipe, citric acid was used for its preparation. Commercially, this is often replaced by vinegar. Salt is also added. The oil in the mustard seeds is not removed. 
Dijon mustard is not especially hot compared with English mustard. However, it is hotter than Bordeaux mustard, which is pretty mild. 
Dijon mustard is used for many recipes in French cuisine. As an example, the original mayonnaise recipe uses Dijon mustard.

Croatian Spring

Maspok (after Masovni pokret (Croatian), i.e. Mass movement) or Croatian spring was a nationalistic and a secessionist movement in the Socialist Republic of Croatia, Yugoslavia during the year of 1971. The movement demands were initially around exclusiоn of Serbian language use and the exclusive use of the Croatian language in Croatia, declaration of Croatia as a national state of Croats and Croatia as a sequel of the medieval Croatian kingdom. The ultimate Maspok goal was independent Croatian state. The Maspok movement was supported by a great part of the Croatian Communists, Croatian republic political leadership, and the Ustaše emigration in the West.
Movement political demands.
There were three basic points the Maspok used to attack the Yugoslavia's federal state: distribution of the Croatia's tourism industry revenue in Yugoslavia, the amount of money Croatia contributed to the underdeveloped Yugoslav republics fund and the question of the official Croatian language in Croatia. Maspok demanded recognition of the Croatian language as the official language in Croatia, its exclusive use in education, media, and the state affairs which meant expulsion the Serbian language from Croatia . Maspok insisted on specific nature of the Croats and their culture and the civilization and cultural differences between Croats and other ethnic groups and ethnic minorities in Yugoslavia. The movement, broadly supported by Croats, demanded a separate national Croatian bank, Croatian army, and, separate of the Yugoslavian, Croatian representative in the United Nations. "Matica hrvatska" (a Croatian cultural organization) and "Hrvatski tjednik" (Croatian Weekly newspaper) went so far to publish a constitution draft of the new Croatian state."Matica hrvatska" published (November 1971) a full list of the Maspok's demands: Croatia defined as the state of Croatian people only, Croatian representative in the United Nations, Croatian national bank and national currency, Croatian army and Croat conscripts serving only Croatian army, Croatian language used in the army, Croatian state affairs, education, and media. "Matica hrvatska", at the time the Maspok movement culmination, cancelled the work on the Serbo-Croatian dictionary and rejected the Novi Sad Agreement (about the common Serbo-Croatian language). The Novi Sad Agreement based Serbo-Croatian language orthography was replaced by the Croatian language orthography written by S. Babic, B. Finka, and M. Mogus and printed by the "Matica hrvatska" the same 1971. year. Zagreb University provided a broad and a public support to the Maspok political demands. The Zagreb University students staged mass demonstrations in Croatia in order to express their support to Maspok .
Maspok development and demise.
According to some historians, Maspok was an Ustaše insurgency in Yugoslavia mentored, guarded and supported by Savka Dabčević-Kučar, Miko Tripalo and Pero Pirker, the political leadership of the Croatian Communist League. There was some evidence that Dabcevic-Kucar and Tripalo cooperated with the Ustaše leadership abroad and, following the Ustaše directives, worked on the destruction of the Yugoslav state.. That time the Croatian Communist League general secretary, Miloš Žanko, publicly denounced the destructive nationalism of "Matica hrvatska", Dabčević-Kučar, Tripalo, and Pirker. Žanko, on the Tenth plenum of the Croatian Communists (January 1970) accused Dabčević-Kučar, Tripalo, and Piker claiming that these three worked along with "Matica hrvatska" against the Yugoslav socialism and on the destabilization of Yugoslavia. . By the Josip Broz approval and the Bakarić's help, Žanko was excommunicated from the Croatian Communist League on the same plenum . Another strong opposition to Maspok came from the members of the Zagreb Praxis group (Rudi Supek, Milan Kangrga, most notably) .
Some minor actions against Serbs in Croatia were demonstrated by defacing or destroying cyrillic signs and by outbreaks of violence at soccer matches. The Croatian leadership persuaded Broz that they had the situation under control. When Broz visited Croatia in July 1971 the Croatian anthem was played after the Yugoslav one.
Josip Broz suppressed Maspok and, at the same time, made a great concession to the Croatian nationalism. Broz allowed use of the Croatian language in Croatia and confederalized Yugoslav Constitution in 1974, giving a veto rights to the Yugoslav republics when eventually attempting to change the Constitution. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution was a source of a great dissatisfaction and concern of the Serbs in Yugoslavia . The Croatian Communist League leadership, Dabčević-Kučar, Tripalo, and Pirker were forced to resign from their state and the Communist League positions and some of the Maspok leaders were arrested and imprisoned. . Among the arrested Maspok leaders were Franjo Tuđman and Bruno Bušić.
Broz's persecution of Serbian academia and liberals in other Yugoslav republics.
During the year of 1972. Broz removed from the politics and state affairs Serbian Communists Marko Nikezić and Latinka Perović, Slovene Stane Kavčič, and Macedonian Krste Crvenkovski. According to historians, the rule of the for-life Yugoslav President were more dangerous Yugoslav liberals than the Croatian Maspok .
In order to consolate Croatian nationalists, Broz persecuted Serbian academics who pointed at subordinated position of the Serbian people in Yugoslavia. The two leading Serbian intellectuals, Dobrica Ćosić (prominent Serbian writer) and Mihailo Đurić (Belgrade University Law School professor) questioned justification of the Albanian autonomy on the historic Serbian province Kosovo and asked why the Serbs in Croatia did not have any autonomous status, and why Vojvodina had the autonomous status despite the fact that the majority of her inhabitants were the Serbs. These two intellectuals were publicly denounced by the Broz's regime and persecuted. Professor Đurić, seeing the escalation of the Maspok nationalism and secessionism in Croatia, warned that that time Serbia's status in Yugoslavia was highly discriminatory and that Serbia was mercilessly and unjustly accused for advocating centralism and unitarianism. Đurić warned further that it was forbidden to raise questions about responsibility of those who committed the genocide of Serbian people in the Independent State of Croatia during the WWII. He said that the borders of the Socialist Republic of Serbia are not national nor historic borders of the Serbs in Yugoslavia. . The Prof. Đurić trial and verdict were the part of the Broz's regime political equilibrium in the time of the Maspok activity culmination in Croatia and the time of the Maspok's leadership trial and imprisonment .
Croatian Spring and dissolution of Yugoslavia.
Croatian Spring played a significant role in the drafting Yugoslav Constitution of 1974. The Constitution paralyzed the federal power of Yugoslavia by shifting the state administrative power to the Yugoslav republics.. The Constitution, being insufficiently unclear and already the result of compromises with various nationalist groups in the republics and provinces, was a blueprint for secession.

Lieutenant general

Lieutenant general or lieutenant-general (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG etc.), is a military rank (NATO code OF-8). It is used in many countries. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield. The lieutenant general was normally subordinate to a captain general.
In modern armies, lieutenant general normally ranks directly below a general and above a major general. It is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral. In air forces with a separate rank structure, it is equivalent to air marshal. In the US Army a lieutenant general usually commands an army corps. 
In a number of countries, the rank of lieutenant general is the highest army rank in use. In Latvia and Lithuania, the chief of defence is a lieutenant general. In the Irish Defence Forces and Israeli forces, the Chief of Staff holds this rank.

Ruffin's recording of "What Becomes of the Brokenhearted" became a major success. It was able to peak at #7 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and #6 on the R&B Chart. It remains as his most well known song. 
On October 17, 2014, it was reported that Ruffin was gravely ill and was taken into an intensive care unit in a Las Vegas hospital. Ruffin died on November 17, 2014 in Las Vegas, aged 78.

Battle of Atlanta

The Battle of Atlanta (22 July 1864) was a major battle of the American Civil War. The battle was part of the Atlanta Campaign directed by Union Army general William Tecumseh Sherman. The city of Atlanta was a major supply center, railroad hub and symbol of the Confederate States of America. Its loss proved to be a major blow to the Confederacy and led to the end of the Civil war.
Background.
Military.
The war had been going on for three years when Ulysses S. Grant was given overall command of the Union Army. While a much smaller army, the Confederates had been moving their forces to battle whichever Union army was active at the time. By doing this, they had won most of the battles. Grant decided to coordinate his armies and defeat the confederates. His field armies would all engage the confederate field armies at the same time. This would pin down the smaller southern armies so the Union army could defeat them. Grant would personally lead the Army of the Potomac against Confederate general Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia. He would try to capture the capital of the confederacy, Richmond. Sherman would move his combined armies against the Confederate Army of Tennessee led by General Joseph E. Johnston. One of Sherman's goals was to capture the South's second largest city, Atlanta. If successful, it would shorten the war.
Political.
By 1864 President Abraham Lincoln was in political trouble. When elected in 1860 Lincoln had won a majority of the Electoral College votes. But he only won 39.8% of the popular vote. He was probably the least popular president when he took office in 1861. Seven southern states had broken away and formed the Confederate States of America. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began. The war had gone badly for the Union. Even though they had a much larger army, they had lost a number of battles. By 1864 Lincoln needed some victories if he wanted to be reelected that November. If successful, the Atlanta Campaign could guarantee Lincoln would remain president.
Atlanta campaign.
The Atlanta Campaign began on 6 May 1864. Sherman had over 100,000 men he divided into three field armies. Johnston's army was only about half the size of the Union army facing him. Sherman used his larger army in a series of battles to push Johnston back. He used two of his armies facing Johnston's Army of Tennessee. The third army was used in flanking maneuvers. Finally, Johnston retreated into Atlanta on July 9–10. Johnston's strategy had been to "trade space for men and time". He would not commit his army to a major battle but delayed and harassed Sherman every chance he got. It took Sherman 72 days to march his armies only 100 miles. Johnston's plan was to slow down and wear out the Union army and make them tired of fighting. But Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, dismissed Johnston for not stopping the Union army. He gave command to John B. Hood, Johnston's second in command. 
The battle.
When Hood took over command of the Army of Tennessee, Sherman was only five miles from Atlanta. Hood was the most aggressive general the confederacy had. He intended to defend Atlanta. On July 20 Hood's army attacked Union general George Henry Thomas's Army of the Cumberland. John Schofield's Army of the Ohio and James B. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee were both moving around the Confederate right and could not help Thomas. But Thomas's army stood fast. The Confederates withdrew after losing 2,500 killed or wounded. Hood next attacked on 22 July. He threw his entire force against McPherson's Army of the Tennessee on Sherman's left flank. The battle started about noon and lasted until midnight. 
During the fighting general Dodge (the author) could see a gap in the Union lines. He sent messengers to warn the commanders to move to close the gap or the Confederates would break through. Apparently General McPherson saw the same gap. He rode out with a staff officer to close the gap. He came upon confederate skirmishers who ordered him to surrender. He turned and spurred his horse to escape, but was shot and killed. At one point the Union line broke. But cannon fire from Schofield's Army of the Ohio and a counterattack drove the Confederates back. Hood lost about 8,000 (killed, wounded and missing) to 3,722 Union losses. After the battle Hood fell back to defend Atlanta. He had little to show for his attacks except a high casualty rate the Confederates could not afford. 
Sherman set up his cannon and began a bombardment of Atlanta that would last a month. Then Sherman withdrew his armies leaving only a small force. As intended, Hood's army followed them to Jonesboro, Georgia. Sherman's army destroyed the railway tracks back to Atlanta. The Battle of Jonesborough lasted two days and ended on 1 September. After taking more heavy casualties, what was left of Hood's army burned their supplies and ammunition and left Atlanta. Sherman then took Atlanta. This was a major loss for the confederacy. It almost guaranteed Lincoln's reelection. The Battle of Atlanta marked the halfway point in the Atlanta campaign.

Hyperthermia

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Hyperthermia is a high body temperature, which is due to failed thermoregulation. Normally, when there is a pathogen, the human body reacts with fever, which is a high body temperature. Hyperthermia is not caused by pathogens, so the drugs that reduce fever will not work. 
There are different forms of hyperthermia; certain drugs, such as ecstasy may cause it.
The opposite of hyperthymia is hypothermia.

Supply depot

A Supply depot is a type of military installation used to store military supplies. They are usually near the front lines so they can provide supplies to their military units. Supply depots store and wikt:distribute the equipment and supplies a military needs to operate. These are often kept in buildings called warehouses. Modern supply depots do not typically store ammunition. Because of the dangers of storing live ammunition and explosives they are kept separate in an ammunition dump. Supply depots are usually run by a logistics officer. He or she is responsible for getting supplies to units who need them when they need them. Supply depots are often the targets of enemy raids. By destroying an enemy's supplies, it hurts their ability to fight.

José, Prince of Brazil

Infante José of Portugal, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza (20 August 1761 – 11 September 1788) was the heir apparent to the Kingdom of Portugal until his death in 1788, as the eldest child of Queen Maria I of Portugal and King Pedro III of Portugal. He was also the Prince of Beira but better known as the Prince of Brazil. 
José died of smallpox at the age of 27, causing his younger and ill-prepared brother, Infante João, to become heir-apparent and eventually King. João's reign would be a turbulent one, seeing Napoleonic invasion of Portugal and the loss of the Portuguese Empire's largest and wealthiest colony, Brazil.
Early life.
José was born at the "Real Barraca" where the Palace of Ajuda in Lisbon stands today. He was named after his grandfather who was the ruling King of Portugal at the time of his birth. His grandfather created him "Prince of Beira", this being the first time when the title was given to a male.
At the time of his birth, his parents were the Prince and Princess of Brazil, his mother the Heir presumptive of the king.
Marriage.
On 21 February 1777, he married his 30-year-old aunt the Infanta Benedita of Portugal. José was 15 years old. Benedita was an attractive woman and the main candidate for the wife of José. The marriage was the great wish of king José.
They had no children. Benedita miscarried twice, in 1781 and in 1786. Three days after their wedding, José's grandfather and Benedita's father the old King José died, and his mother succeeded as queen in her own right. Infante José became the new crown prince, being accorded the titles Prince of Brazil and 14th Duke of Braganza.
Death and legacy.
José died at the age of 27 of smallpox. Upon José's death, his younger brother Infante John became heir-apparent to the throne and thus the new Prince of Brazil. José died on the Ajuda Royal Complex in Lisbon. His mother and wife were very badly affected by his death. His wife would be known as the "Dowager Princess of Brazil" till her death in 1829.
Burial.
José is buried in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza in Lisbon, the resting place for most of the members of the House of Braganza.

Bottom trawling

Bottom trawling is trawling (towing a trawl, which is a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is also called "dragging". Bottom trawling can be either benthic trawling or demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the bottom.
Another kind of trawling is midwater trawling (also known as pelagic trawling). This is where a net is towed higher in the water column. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, tuna, and mackerel. Bottom trawling catches both bottom-living fish. It also catches semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish. Trawling is done by a trawler. This can be a small open boat or a large factory trawler.
Trawl nets.
The trawl doors disturb the sea bed. They create a cloud of muddy water which hides the oncoming trawl net. It also makes a noise which attracts fish. The fish begin to swim in front of the net mouth. As the trawl continues along the seabed, fish begin to tire and slip backwards into the net. Finally, the fish become exhausted and drop back, into the net and are caught. The speed that the trawl is towed at depends on the swimming speed of the species which is being targeted. It also depends on the gear that is being used. For most species, a speed of around 4 knots (7 km/h) is appropriate. Trawling is very easy way of catching large amounts of fish. But it has been compared to "fishing with bulldozers". Like a bulldozer it scrapes up everything on the bottom.
Environmental impacts.
Bottom trawling has operated for over a century on heavily fished areas like the North Sea and Grand Banks. overfishing has long been seen as causing major ecological changes to the fish species on the Grand Banks. Lately there is concern about the damage which benthic trawling does to the seabed. A species of particular concern is the slow-growing, deep water coral "Lophelia pertusa". This species is home to a large community of deep sea organisms. It is easily damaged by fishing gear. On November 17, 2004 the United Nations General Assembly urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling. Bottom trawling has been blamed for reducing the populations of many of fish species. These include species such as orange roughy, barndoor skate, shark, and many others.

Ligature (typography)

In writing and typography, a ligature is when two or more graphemes (~letters) are joined as a single glyph. Ligatures usually replace two characters next to each other. The idea comes from handwriting and manuscripts.
Example: the common ampersand ("&") represents the Latin conjunction "et", meaning "and". The ampersand's symbol is a ligature, joining the old handwritten Latin letters "e" and "t" of the word "et", so that the word is represented as a single glyph.
Sometimes ligatures are made to make things more easy to read, or simply to make the writing/font nicer to look at. This is important in some forms of design work. 
Type designers, who create fonts (or 'typefaces'), make ligatures for some combinations of letters. Today, most fonts are made on computers (these are called 'digital typefaces'). When two particular letters are typed together, the ligature will appear. The ligature look like the two different letters but slightly changed (sometimes joined together). It is actually a separate symbol that has been drawn by the creator, and is programmed to appear when two letters are put next to each other.

The Frugal Gourmet

The Frugal Gourmet is an American half-hour cooking show. The show started around 1973 at Tacoma's public-TV station KTPS-TV. It was first called "Cooking Fish Creatively". Later it was renamed "The Frugal Gourmet". The award winning program was hosted by Jeff Smith. 
History.
Jeff Smith was the chaplain at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. In the late 1960s he taught a class called ”Food as Sacrament and Celebration". In 1972, he left the university and opened a restaurant called 'the Chaplain’s Pantry'. In 1973, a local PBS television station KTPS-TV offered him his own cooking show, called "Cooking Fish Creatively". "I had a producer who couldn't produce, a director who couldn't direct, a technician who couldn't tech, and I wasn't so good, either", according to Smith. The show received two Emmy nominations. The show won a 'Best of the West' Award for Educational Television in 1976. After several seasons it was renamed "The Frugal Gourmet". The name change was suggested by his wife, Patty. 
The Frugal Gourmet ran on PBS from 1983 to 1997. It was PBS's most popular cooking show. Smith always wore a blue and white striped apron that became his "trademark". In 1986 Smith was joined by Craig Wollam, a professionally trained Chef. Smith met Wollam by accident in a Chicago restaurant and he was hired the next day. He stayed until the show was cancelled in 1997.
For the first seven seasons starting in 1983, the show was produced at by WTTW in Chicago. From 1990 it was produced by A La Carte Productions.
Format.
During each show Smith followed a recipe showing how to prepare a dish. He showed food from many different cultures. The show always ended with Smith saying "Until I see you again, this is the Frugal Gourmet; I bid you peace, bye-bye". Smith would remind his audience that "frugal" doesn't mean cheap. It means that you don't waste money. And "gourmet" means loving good food and wine.
Theme song.
The theme music for "The Frugal Gourmet" was the Bourree movement from "Water Music" by George Frideric Handel.

Xenolith

A xenolith (Ancient Greek: 
 
 "foreign rock") is a rock fragment which another rock surrounds. 
It happens most in igneous rock when magma is fluid enough to flow round more solid rock. Xenoliths may be covered in the margins of a magma chamber, torn loose from the walls of a flow of lava or picked up along the ground by flowing lava on Earth's surface. A xenocryst is an individual foreign crystal included within an igneous body. Examples of xenocrysts are quartz crystals in a low-silica lava and diamonds in kimberlite diatremes.
Although the term xenolith is most commonly associated with igneous inclusions, a broad definition could include rock fragments which have become encased in sedimentary rock. Xenoliths are sometimes found in meteorites.
Xenoliths and xenocrysts provide important information about the composition of the otherwise inaccessible mantle. Basalts, kimberlites, lamproites and lamprophyres, which have their source in the upper mantle, often contain fragments and crystals assumed to be a part of the lower mantle mineralogy.

Transport hub

A transport hub (also transport interchange) is a place where passengers and cargo are exchanged between transport modes. Public transport hubs include train stations, rapid transit stations, bus stops, tram stop, airports and ferry slips. Freight hubs include classification yards, seaports and truck terminals, or combinations of these. For private transport, the parking lot functions as a hub. 
Delta Air Lines first used the hub and spoke system for aviation in 1955 from its hub in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. This was to compete with Eastern Air Lines. FedEx adopted the hub and spoke model for overnight package delivery during the 1970s. When the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, Delta's hub and spoke system was used by several airlines.

Cheese mite

Cheese mites are mites which live in food, grain and plant leaves. 
They are sometimes found in flour but prefer cheese. Refrigerated cheese is not usually affected as they prefer warm, damp foods. Cheese mites are used to make certain cheeses. Milbenkäse and Mimolette are two examples. The action of the mites on the surface of these cheeses adds to the flavor. It also gives them a distinctive appearance. A 2010 SEM study found that Milbenkäse cheese was produced using "Tyrolichus casei" mites, while Mimolette cheese used "Acarus siro" mites (also known as flour mites).

Apoica pallens

The Central American paper wasp ("Apoica pallens") is a nocturnal eusocial wasp (family Vespidae). It is famous for its swarming behavior. It is native to the lowlands of central and northern South America. 
This species has developed special night vision adaptations which help their night-time swarming and foraging behavior. It has important medicinal properties for the Pankararé people of Brazil.
Distribution and habitat.
"Apoica pallens" populations are native to the lowlands of Central and northern South America. Generally, they are found in areas of tropical savanna, semi-deciduous tropical dry forest, gallery forest, and marshland. "Apoica" is one of the prominent genera of the New World tropics, and is rather abundant.
Swarming.
"Apoica pallens" is best known for its unique swarm founding behavior, in which the adult population of a colony abandons an old nest and emigrates to a new site. This has been observed for several reasons. Firstly, as part of normal colony reproduction. And secondly, in response to severe disturbance or destruction of the original nest. Additionally, nest abandonment is sometimes correlated with changing climates, and in the case of "Apoica pallens," has been observed more frequently during the dry season. Males follow swarm emigrations and may stay with the newly created colony for the following weeks.
Epiponini are either permanently or mainly polygynous.
Other behavior.
Foraging.
Foraging takes place at night. Swarms of wasps explosively leave the nest, then quickly return only to leave again in a similar fashion. As the night progresses there are moderate to heavy levels of return and departures by smaller groups of wasps. The foraging patterns of "Apoica pallens" depends on the moon’s cycle: when the moon is new, it forages during the first four hours after sunset, with another small peak of activity just before dawn as wasps return to the nest. When the moon is waxing, it extends the hours of forage until individuals are out all night long.
Their adaptations allow them to forage in low light conditions. These wasps have larger visual fields compared to those of relatives.
Dominance hierarchy.
"Apoica pallens" is a caste species with morphological differentiation between females. These castes are classified as workers and queens. This is based on the size of ovaries. The differences between the castes of queens and workers are formed during the larval stage. Queen-destined larvae show faster growth rates in various bodily compartments than worker-destined larvae. This results in individuals with different shapes even though larvae are about the same size.
Uses in folk medicine.
Folk medicine is prominent in various areas of Brazil. Insects are used in folk remedies. Medicinal insects are the focus of healing methods targeted to treat ailments, serving as drug resources that come from nature. The nests of "Apoica pallens", is known to be significant in the practices of Pankarare ́Indians and also the rural people of Brazil. 
Nests of these wasps are burned and the smoke released is inhaled in order to heal stroke. Furthermore, when the presence of evil is suspected in an Indian’s life, they must bath in this smoke of the burning nest as treatment. In Matinha dos Pretos, pieces of the nest may be boiled in water to make a tea that serves as treatment for asthma.
Diet.
"Apoica pallens" collects various arthropods including flies, caterpillars, and beetles. It also collects pollen and nectar from banana blossoms. This species practices brood cannibalism: the adults will eat some of the brood if their own nutritional needs are not met. Generally, several adults will divide up a single larva. In addition, adults will exchange food via trophallaxis.
Defense.
"Apoica pallens" displays active, rather than chemical defense behavior. During the day, when adult individuals are not swarming, they cover the comb face of the nest several layers thick. The wasps on the outer layer of the comb face outward. They watch for predatory ants trying to reach the interior of the nest. It is thought that the advantages of this protective formation during the day is what led to the nocturnal foraging and swarming.

Handbag

A handbag is a medium-to-large bag typically used by women to hold personal items. It is often fashionably designed. Versions of the term are 'purse', 'pocketbook', 'pouch', or 'clutch', terms which suggest rather smaller versions.
Content of handbags might include such items as wallet/coins, keys, mobile phone, cosmetics and jewellery, books/e-books, pen and paper, food and beverage such as a water bottle, pepper spray and other items for self-defence, tampons and other feminine hygiene products, contraceptives, tissues and infant care products, or a hairbrush.
Men's purses.
Men once carried coin purses. The oldest known purse dates back more than 5000 years, and was worn by a man, Ötzi the Iceman. In early modern Europe, men's trousers replaced men's breeches during the 18th and 19th centuries. Pockets were added in the loose, heavy material. This let men carry coins, and then paper currency, in small leather wallets.

Donauparkhalle was an indoor ice rink in Vienna-Donaustadt in Austria. It was originally built as an expo venue in 1964, next to an earlier landfill in Donaupark near Kaisermühlen, to be used for the garden-themed exhibition Wiener Internationale Gartenschau. Two years later, it was rebuilt into an indoor ice rink. During the 1966/1967 season, Wiener EV played its first home games inside. Later, it was used as home venue for the Vienna club WAT Stadlau. The venue was popular for its acoustics. The venue was demolished following the 1990/1991 season. In the early 1990's, the area was planned to be used for the 1995 world exhebition that was never hosted.
Major events.
In 1967 the Wiener Stadthallenturnier, despite the name, was held there instead of inside the Wiener Stadthalle. Even the world championships in ice stock sport and nine-pin bowling have been held inside. 
Even the 1967 World Ice Hockey Championships and the 1987 World Ice Hockey Championships were held inside. The World Figure Skating Championships have also been held here.

Argument from ignorance

An argument from ignorance (Latin: "argumentum ad ignorantiam" 
 
), or appeal to ignorance ('ignorance' stands for "lack of evidence to the contrary"), is a fallacy in informal logic. It says something is true because it has not yet been proved false. Or, that something is false if it has not yet been proved true. This is also called a negative proof fallacy. This also includes the (false) assumption there are only two options (true or false). There may be as many as four choices:
Appeals to ignorance are often used to suggest the other side needs to do the proving. Rules of logic place the burden (responsibility) of proving something on "the person making the claim". 
A logical fallacy is simply a bad argument. Using bad logic does not necessarily mean the argument is false (or true). It is basically a hasty conclusion, one that is arrived at incorrectly. But it still may be convincing to some audiences. This is why it is used in politics and advertising.

Matthias Jakob Schleiden (5 April 1804 – 23 June 1881) was a German botanist. He was long supposed to be the co-founder of the cell theory, with Theodor Schwann and Rudolf Virchow. However, a recent study of the original papers revealed that Schleiden and Schwann used previous research, and were popularisers of an idea others had discovered.
Modern assessment.
The earlier work of the Czech Jan Purkyně (1787–1869) and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810–1883) was "unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority in the cell theory".Chapter 9 
Johannes Müller (1801–1858) also made great contributions. It was, however, his student Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden who got the credit for the cell theory. This was despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and their credits to previous workers were "a travesty".p97 As understood now, the cell theory includes these important ideas:
The key works of Schwann and Schleiden were published in 1838 and 1839.
These ideas still are the basic ideas of cell theory.

Coordinates: 
The Yarra River is also known as the Yarra Yarra River, Aboriginal: Berrern, Birr-arrung, Bay-ray-rung, Birarang. Birrarung, and Wongete). The Yarra river is a perennial river in east-central Victoria, Australia. The river flows from its source in the Yarra Ranges 242 km west through the Yarra Valley. The river opens out into plains as it winds its way through Greater Melbourne. It then empties into Hobsons Bay in northernmost Port Phillip.
The river was a major food source for indigenous Australians during prehistoric times. It also served as a meeting place during those times. The river was first called "Birrarung" by the Wurundjeri. The current name was translated wrong from another Wurundjeri term in the Boonwurrung language; "Yarro-yarro", meaning "ever-flowing".
The river was used for agriculture by early European settlers. The landscape of the river has changed since 1835. The course of the river has been changed and widened in places. Widening and dams, like the Upper Yarra Reservoir have helped protect Melbourne from major flooding. Industrialisation led to the destruction of the marshlands at the joining of the Yarra and Maribyrnong Rivers in the area around Coode Island in West Melbourne. The yearly Moomba festival celebrates the Yarra River's meaning to Melbourne.

Murder (United States law)

Under the laws of the United States of America, the crime of Murder can fall under different jurisdictions. In some cases, the state prosecutes those accused of murder. In other cases, the federal government has jurisdiction. Who the victim of a murder is can also determine who has jurisdiction. The military of the United States also prosecutes murder under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
Jurisdiction.
If a murder is committed within the borders of a state, that state has jurisdiction. If the crime is committed in the District of Columbia, the D.C Superior Court has jurisdiction. In cases involving federal property or employees, the federal courts may have exclusive jurisdiction. The prosecution of murder is similar in Australia.
If the victim is a federal official, an ambassador, consul or other foreign official under US protection, then the federal government has jurisdiction. If the the crime took place on federal property or involved crossing state lines it is under federal jurisdiction. Murder on naval or U.S. flagged merchant vessels in international waters is under federal jurisdiction. This is true also if crime happens on U.S. military bases worldwide. Murder by a member of the United States military anywhere in the world is a violation of Article 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The trial is held by a general court-martial. 
Dual sovereignty.
In the United States the dual sovereignty doctrine applies to murder as well as to other crimes. In cases where a murder involves both state and federal jurisdiction, the accused can be tried and punished separately by each jurisdiction. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine this is not considered double jeopardy. If another federal law was violated in connection with a murder, then the murder can be prosecuted by a federal court. This is called "piggyback jurisdiction". In the United States there is no statute of limitations on the crime of murder. But most other federal laws have a five-year statute of limitations. An exception is for cases of terrorism where the statute of limitations is eight years. Or if explosives or arson were involved, the statute of limitations is ten years.

Grapheme

A grapheme is a written mark which corresponds to a spoken sound, or a bit of written language (orthography). It roughly corresponds to a phoneme in speech.
Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols of any of the world's writing systems. The separate items on a keyboard all produce graphemes when writing in the appropriate software.
A grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme.
A grapheme is an abstract concept. A glyph is a specific shape that represents that grapheme, in a specific typeface. For example, the abstract concept of "the Arabic numeral one" is a grapheme which has different glyphs in different typefaces.

It was later released in the United States on October 31, 2014. The movie was an adaptation of S. J. Watson's 2011 novel of the same name. The movie stars Nicole Kidman, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and Anne-Marie Duff.
Plot.
Forty-year old Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman) wakes up with a man whom she doesn't know. The man calls himself Ben (Colin Firth), her husband. Ben shows her pictures of what her life once was. He tells her that she was involved in a accident ten years ago. This, he explains, has left her brain damage. This affects her memory in which she constantly wakes up not knowing anything of the day. Ben tells her that she's been like this since the accident. Ben leaves the house for work. While Christine looks around the house, a neurologist named Dr. Nasch calls the house. He informs her that she has been in treatment with him for the past few years. He tells her to locate a video camera which is hidden inside her closet. He tells her to watch the videos and to call him back. Christine watches a video diary of herself, which she is unfamiliar with. Dr. Nasch tells Christine to not inform Ben of the camera. Dr. Nasch also tells her that she lost her memory after she was attacked and left for dead at a nearby airport hotel. Christine wonders why Ben lied to her about the accident. Dr. Nasch tells her that it may be Ben's way of accepting her current condition. 
Over time, Christine faintly remembers a woman named Claire. Ben tells her that Claire was her best friend. Claire couldn't handle Christine's condition and ended contact with her. Later, Christine remembers that she had a son. Christine confronts Ben on why he would hide her son from her. Ben tells her that their son died on meningitis when he was eight. Christine remembers the name "Mike". She believes he was the attacker. She tells Dr. Nasch of the name. Christine then see's Dr. Nasch's name tag. It reads Mike. Christine opens the door of the car and tries to runaway. Dr. Nasch then injects her with a drug that calms her down. The next day she remembers nothing. 
Christine learns that Ben had placed her in an assisted care home. She also learns that they have been divorced for several years. Christine also learns that Claire had been trying to contact her. She was unaware that Ben took her away. Christine is given Claire's phone number. They agreed to meet at a local park. Claire reveals that she had a one-time sexual affair with Ben. This happened before Christine's attack. Christine is angry at this and leaves Claire at the park. Christine believes that Ben still loves her. She records her feelings about Ben to remind herself that Ben is a great ex-husband. Later that night, Christine decides to let Ben see the video she made. Christine tells her how much she cares and loves him. Ben, upset, slaps Christine in the face. Ben leaves Christine on the floor as he leaves.
Christine calls Claire of what Ben had done. Claire tells her that she will call Ben. She tells her that she will find out way he has done this. Claire calls Christine back. She tells her that Ben have not seen her for several years. Claire asks Christine to describe the "Ben" she is living with. They both realize that he is not "Ben". Christine attempts to escape the house. "Ben" knocks Christine unconscious. The next morning, Christine awakens with no memories. 
That night, "Ben" takes her to a hotel. The hotel is close to where she had been found. He reveals that he is Mike. The man she had an affair with. He tells her that he wanted Christine to tell Ben about them. He tells her that she didn't want to do that. Upset, he attacked her which resulted in her amnesia. He also reveals that Christine's son Adam is still alive. He then deletes all the videos Christine had recorded. He tells her that he is no longer wanting to play the part of Ben. He declares his love for her. He demands that Christine leaves with him. Another struggle occurs. However, Christine knocks Mike out and gets away. Christine wakes up in a hospital bed. She is visited by Dr. Nasch. He tells her the man responsible for her condition has been arrested. Christine is then visited by the real Ben, as well as their son Adam, now a teenager.

Werribee River

Coordinates: 
The Werribee River is a perennial river that flows across the volcanic plains west of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. One of the main rivers which flows into the Werribee River is the Lerderderg River. It begins in the hills near Ballan and flows for 110 kms before reaching Port Phillip Bay near the city of Werribee. 
Much of the area along the river is protected by parks, including the Werribee Gorge State Park. The river also flows through the Werribee Open Range Zoo. The Werribee River Trail follows the river from Tarneit to Werribee.
The Werribee River flows into the Melton Reservoir. Water from the river is used to irrigate the market gardens of Bacchus Marsh and Werribee South. The Western Treatment Plant, the main sewerage treatment plant for Melbourne, is near the river mouth on the bay.
History.
Before the arrival of white settlers, the Werribee River was the boundary of the Bunurong tribe. Its six clans lived along the Victorian coast across the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay to Wilsons Promontory.
In the late 1830s and 1840s the Werribee River was the scene of fighting between the Wautharong people and the European settlers. The squatter Charles Franks and a shepherd were speared to death near Mount Cottrell in July 1836. Because of this, John Batman led a group of men to punish the aborigines. They found a large group of aborigines and shot them, killing at least ten. There are also reports of flour containing arsenic being given to local aborigines.
In 1851 a large timber bridge was built to cross the Werribee River to replace an earlier wooden bridge. In 1852 this bridge was washed away when the river flooded.
In August 2004 the Victorian Government promised $300,000 to fix the Werribee River. This involved removing willow trees which were choking the river around the township and replacing them with native plants.
The name.
The explorers Hume and Hovell camped by the river on 15 December 1824. They named it the "Arndell" after Hovell's father-in-law. John Helder Wedge 're-discovered' the river in 1835 and at first called it the "Peel", but then changed it to the "Ex" or "Exe". Exford, an early crossing place on the river, is based on this name. One of the local Wautharong speaking Kulin tribesman that accompanied Wedge said the name for the stream was 'Weariby Yallock' ('yallock' meaning 'stream'). The spelling changed to the present form of "Werribee. T"he original aboriginal word meant "spine" or "backbone".
Things to do.
There are many things to do along the river. A network of bike and walking trails along the river showcase the many different kinds of plants and animals that live along the river. 
There are many fishing spots along the river. There are places to launch canoe and boats at the Werribee South Boat Ramp and Riverbend Historical Park.
Bird watching is also a popular activity. Care must be taken as there are Eastern Brown Snakes and other deadly fauna living near the river.

Tonic (music)

In music, the tonic note is the first note in a diatonic scale. It is the tonal centre, or the tone on which the music sounds finished. The triad, or chord, based on the tonic note, is the tonic chord. All other notes in a piece of music use the tonic note as a reference point. Musical scales are named after the tonic note. For example, the tonic of a scale of C, is the note C. The tonic is always numbered as one, or in traditional music theory as I (using Roman numerals).

<doc id="468808" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=468808" title="THX">
THX

THX is the trade name of a high-fidelity sound reproduction standard. It was used for movie theaters, screening rooms, home theaters, computer speakers, gaming consoles, and car audio systems. 
THX stands for "Tomlinson Holman's eXperiment". THX was developed by Tomlinson Holman at George Lucas's company Lucasfilm in 1982 to ensure that the soundtrack for the third "Star Wars" movie, "Return of the Jedi", would be accurately reproduced in the best venues.
The THX system is not a recording technology, and it does not specify a sound recording format. All sound formats, whether digital (Dolby Digital, SDDS) or analog (Dolby SR, Ultra-Stereo), can be "shown in THX." THX is mainly a quality assurance system. THX-certified theaters provide a high-quality, predictable playback environment to ensure that any movie soundtrack mixed in THX will sound as near as possible to the intentions of the mixing engineer. THX also provides certified theaters with a special crossover circuit whose use is part of the standard. Certification of an auditorium entails specific acoustic and other technical requirements; architectural requirements include a floating floor, baffled and acoustically treated walls, no parallel walls (to reduce standing waves), a perforated screen (to allow center channel continuity), and NC30 rating for background noise.
Applications.
THX sets strict standards for high quality sound and images.
According to Tomlinson Holman, the inventor of the THX system, the name of the technology was deliberately chosen because it contained both a reference to his name, and to Lucas's early movie "THX 1138". The original name was "Tom Holman's Crossover" (Crossover being sometimes referred to as Xover) or the "Tom Holman eXperiment."
THX Ltd., the company that licenses THX and the associated technology, is based in San Rafael, California, but has offices in Burbank and Hollywood.
THX launched a certification program for HD video products to ensure HD projectors, LCDs, plasmas and DVRs meet high standards for quality. The TiVo Series3 HD DVR and a number of projectors from Runco and Vidikron became the first THX Certified HD products.
The THX II Certified Car Audio System can be found in many Lincoln automobiles produced since 2003. The system was recently recognized among the Best Car Audio Systems of 2006 by the editors of CNET.
THX Ltd. started a licensing program for home screening rooms in 2005, which requires standards similar in concept, though not in detail, to its cinema certification program; before this happened, there was a very small number of (very expensive) home theatres which were actually constructed to THX Cinema standards, most notable of actor and comedian Eddie Murphy.
The world's largest THX cinema is the Colosseum Kino in Oslo, Norway.
The distinctive crescendo used in the THX trailers is known as the "Deep Note." 
The character in the THX trailers is called "Tex" and was created by John Lasseter at Pixar.
The THX trailer entitled "Cimarron", which first appeared at the start of the 1988 movie "Willow", used music composed by James Horner, while "Grand", which first appeared in theaters, featured a variation of the "Deep Note".
The THX Broadway logo on a DVD has a lower-pitched deep note, while the VHS/Laserdisc logo had a higher-pitched deep-note that was similar to "Wings" (1983).
The first theater THX was used in was at the University of Southern California's Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre as a part of USC's acclaimed film school. The Norris Theatre's THX system is currently second-best in California to that of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
Movie references.
Some trailers have references to, or are stylized to match, various movies. Examples include:

<doc id="468813" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=468813" title="Deep Note">
Deep Note

Deep Note is a crescendo used for THX trailers. It was created by James A. Moorer in 1983, who was now an employee of the Lucasfilm Computer Division. The sound is used on trailers for THX-certified movie theatres and video releases. It was first used in the THX trailer shown before the 1983 premiere of "".
Description.
The U.S. trademark registration for the sound contains this description of it:
The Deep Note had originally been from a soft to a loud pitch. Over the years it has been remixed digitally which made the Deep Note with a more abridged sound. Beginning in 1988 the Deep Note became louder and abridged. In 1993 the Deep Note was cut short to save time for Laserdisc (1995 for VHS). Most recently, however, the Deep Note has been cut short to the single note (where both sounds stay in one pitch). This is in favor of other sound effects in certain THX logos.
The sound is perceived as louder than it actually is; sound designer Gary Rydstrom explains that, "from a technical standpoint, 'Deep Note' just feels loud because it has a spectrum of frequencies that grows from small to large."
James A. Moorer has been quoted as saying, "I like to say that the THX sound is the most widely-recognized piece of computer-generated music in the world. This may or may not be true, but it sounds cool!"
Furthermore,
Previous works.
Prior to the creation of Deep Note, several other works made use of similar techniques of frequency spread.
In their book "Analog Days", Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco point to the track "Spaced", from the 1970 Beaver & Krause album "In a Wild Sanctuary" as the source for Deep Note. They quote synthesizer builder Tom Oberheim as saying the original analog form is much richer than the "digital perfection" used in movie theatres.
Other similar predecessors include:
In popular culture.
The perceived loudness of the Deep Note is frequently depicted as having actual destructive effects:

Interlaced video is a method to display an image progressively. Images are drawn line by line, and interlacing means that the odd lines are drawn first, and the even lines are "filled in" later. This effectively doubles the resolution of the image. The two parts of the image are called "fields", and are transmitted one after the other. 
Telefunken invented the method in the 1920s. Today it is widely used for displaying images and video.

One's complement

The One's complement is an operation that can be done to binary numbers. It is obtained by swapping all the bits in the number, that is, replacing "1" with "0", or "0" with "1". In many systems, this is used to represent the inverse of a number. One of the big problems that occur when using One's complement is that the number zero has two representations, either all 0's or all 1's. Using 4 digits both "0000" and "1111" represent zero. This problem can be solved by using Two's complement.

Earthenware

Earthenware is pottery which is porous (meaning water gets through tiny holes slowly). It was fired at a temperature which did not melt it into a glass-like vitreous form. So it is porous. Many types of pottery have been made from it. Until the 18th century it was the commonest type of pottery outside China.
Earthenware is a type of clay that when fired to make pottery is soft and can be scratched with a knife. It is opaque and has an grainy edge when broken. It is generally easier to shape on the potter's wheel than porcelain. Due to its porosity earthenware must be glazed in order to be watertight. Terracotta is earthenware.
Earthenware articles may be thick and heavy or as thin as bone china and porcelain. They are not translucent and are more easily chipped. They are less strong than stoneware.

Brazil during World War Two

World War II histories often do not mention Brazil during World War Two. Brazil was one of the Allies of World War II. It was also the only Ally from South America to provide troops. The country made significant contributions to the war effort. They sent an expeditionary force to fight alongside the allies in the Italian Campaign. The Brazilian Navy and Air Force helped the Allies in the Atlantic from 1942 until the end of the war in 1945. 
Background.
At the beginning of World War II Brazil was neutral. They traded with both the Allied and Axis Forces. But after 1939 they were cut off from Europe by the war. They turned to the United States as a trading partner. The Americans pressured Brazil to join the Allies. This led to the Joint Brazil-U.S Defense Commission, which was designed to counter Axis influence in South America. At the beginning of 1942 Brazil permitted the US to set up air bases on its soil. This was in exchange for the United States to encourage the formation of an iron-industry in Brazil. In 1939 Brazil broke off diplomatic relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy. 
As a result of Brazil´s decision, from the end of January to July 1942, German navy U-boats sank 13 Brazilian merchant ships, causing severe damage to Brazilian shipping. In total, 21 German and two Italian submarines caused the sinking of 36 Brazilian merchant ships causing 1,691 drownings and 1,079 other casualties. The sinkings were the main reason that led the Brazilian government to declare war against the Axis. Finally, Vargas declared war on both Germany and Italy on August 22 1942. There is known that 9 U-Boats were sunk on the Brazilian Coast over the course of the war.
The Smoking Cobras.
The Brazilian Expeditionary Force or BEF (Portuguese: "Força Expedicionária Brasileira" 
 
) was a force of about 25,344 men. They were organized as a division of the US Fifth Army. They were delayed in getting started by difficulties in getting organized. Some in Brazil thought the government was not that anxious to send troops into battle. A popular saying at the time was that it was more likely for "snakes to smoke" (Portuguese: "Cobras Fumantes" 
 
) than to get the BEF going. It is the same as the saying "When pigs fly", meaning it will probably never happen. When the BEF did enter the war, they proudly wore their arm patch showing a cobra with a pipe in its mouth. They called themselves the "Smoking Cobras". They were organized as a standard American division. They wore American uniforms with Brazilian rank and unit markings. The BEF was divided into three battalions of 5,000 men each. They were the 1st, 6th and 11th regimental combat teams. Their record in Italy was impressive. At Montese the BEF defeated the German 148th Division and the Italian Monte Rosa, San Marco and Italia divisions. They captured 14,700 troops and 800 officers (including 2 Generals). During the eight months of battle in Italy, the BEF captured a total of 20,573 Axis soldiers. They lost 948 men who died while fighting on the front.
Navy and Air Force.
The Brazilian Navy and Air Force played a large role in the Battle of the Atlantic. They started in mid-1942 and operated until the end of the war in 1945. They preformed anti-submarine and patrol operations in the South Atlantic. They had American ships through the Lend-Lease program. They acquired several submarine-chasers, 8 destroyer escorts and 3 Fleet destroyers. The larger destroyers were built in Rio de Janeiro to US designs. Their Air Force received a number of modern plane types. These included Curtiss P-36 Hawks, Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and North American B-25 Mitchells. For patrol aircraft they received Lockheed Hudsons, Lockheed Venturas and long range Consolidated PBY Catalina Flying boats. The effect was almost immediate. Between July and December 1943 alone, the Brazilian Air Force and Navy destroyed six German submarines. Of the 7,000 Brizilian sailors who fought, about 500 were killed in action. During the war the Navy protected 3,164 merchant ships. Only three were sunk while under their protection. Air Force pilots flew a total of 2,550 sorties. They flew only 5% of the missions in theatre. But they destroyed 85% of the ammunition dumps, 36% of the fuel depots and 28% of the bridges while they were active.

Battleship Yamato

The Yamato was a Japanese super battleship that served in the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. Along with its sister ship, the Musashi, they were the largest battleships ever built.
Super battleship.
Yamato was built at Kure, Japan. She entered service on 16 December 1941. It was one of five planned super battleships although only two were built: Yamato and Musashi. The allies had no clue Japan had built these monsters until they were first spotted.
Yamato was huge and displaced 62, 315 tons. Yamato had nine 18-inch guns which were the largest in the world at the time. She was 263 m long. Yamado's armor was 460 mm thick. Her guns were her most feared weapons. They fired shells that weighed 3,200 pounds each (the size of a compact car!). They had a range of 44 km. Yamato was designed to fight and destroy US battleships. But it never faced one in battle.
1941 – 1945.
In the 1920s and 1930s the battleship was the ultimate power in naval warfare. But the Japanese, by their attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 proved aircraft carriers were now the most powerful weapon. This meant battleships were already out of date. When the war started, Yamato was the flagship of the Combined Fleet commander Isoroku Yamamoto. It spent much of 1942 defending Japanese shipping out of Truk. Torpedoed by a US submarine in 1943 it was under repair until 1944. Because attack from the air was now the main threat, Yamato was fitted with additional anti-aircraft guns. In June 1944 Yamato took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. In October Yamato was in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During the battle she fired her guns at US escort carriers thinking they were full sized carriers. She was attacked by several US destroyers and received some damage. Returning to Japan in November she was again fitted with more anti-aircraft guns. By then Japan no longer had the resources to keep Yamato operating. In 1945, Yamato left for Okinawa as part of the suicidal Operation Ten-Go. It was an effort to attack US ships supporting the Battle of Okinawa. But, off the coast of Kagoshima, it was sunk by U.S. aircraft.
After The War....
After the war, the Yamato became a fascinating subject in Japan and elsewhere. In 1985 her wreckage was located under 340 m of water. It lies on the seabed broken into two sections. The name Yamato lives on in the anime series Space Battleship Yamato.

Relational model

The relational model for database management is a database model based on first-order predicate logic. Edgar F. Codd proposed it in 1969. In the relational model of a database, all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. A database organized in terms of the relational model is called relational database.
The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it. The structure in which the data is stored, and the task of responding to users' requests and retrieving the data is left to the database system, and is not visible to the user. 
Most relational databases use the SQL data definition and query language; these systems implement what can be regarded as an engineering approximation to the relational model. A "table" in an SQL database schema corresponds to a predicate variable; the contents of a table to a relation; key constraints, other constraints, and SQL queries correspond to predicates. Today, many database systems are different from the original model. Codd fiercely argued against deviations that compromise the original principles.

John Thompson Dorrance (1873 – 1930) was an American chemist. While working at the Campbell Soup Company he discovered a method to create condensed soup. Dorrance served as president of the Campbell Soup Company from 1914 to 1930.
Early career.
Dorrance was born in Bristol, Pennsylvania November 11, 1873. His parents were John and Eleanor (Thompson) Dorrance. He earned a Bachelor of Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received a PhD degree from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1897. Dorrance then returned to the United States to work for his uncle at the Joseph Cambell Preserve Company. His uncle started him at $7.50 per week. Dr. Dorrance also had to provide his own equipment and supplies for his laboratory. While studdying in Europe, Dorrance became used to having soup with his meals. He wanted to perfect a method of canning soup and adding it their product line. In 1897 he invented condensed soup. By removing the water it reduced the weight of the can. A lighter can cost less to transport to stores. The company was able to sell their condensed soup for 10 cents a can. The product was a success for the company. His uncle raised his pay to $9.00 a week. Dorrance also designed the now classic red and white label for Campbells Soup.
Rise to prominence.
In 1900 Dorrance became vice president of the Joseph Cambell Preserve Company. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris that year, Campbell's soups won a gold medal. The medal is still shown on the soup cans today. Dorrance found that workers had time on their hands watching the soup cook in the factory. To occupy their time Dorrance created a new product: canned pork and beans. In 1914 Dorrance became president of the company, now called the Campbell Soup Company. He died of a heart disease on September 22, 1930 in Camden, New Jersey.

Climax vegetation

In ecology, climax community is a term for a stable biological community of plants, animals and fungi. 
After a process of ecological succession the vegetation in an area reaches a steady state. Its stability is not guaranteed: invasive species and climate change can cause changes. However, relatively, the system is stable.
This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area. The term is sometimes also applied in soil development. 
The idea of a single climatic climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with Frederic Clements in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by Henry Cowles in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term "climax" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.

Uranium mining

Uranium mining takes uranium ore from the ground for processing. Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 64% of world uranium production. Uranium from mining is mostly used as fuel for nuclear power plants. Health and environmental studies show that radiation exposure poses a risk for uranium miners. In 1990, Congress passed legislation to help those affected by mining. As of July 2014, the price of uranium concentrate remained near a five-year low, the uranium price having fallen more than 50% from the peak price in January 2011, and reflecting loss of demand following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Some plans for new mines and mine expansion have been deferred. 
Background.
The worldwide production of uranium in 2012 amounted to 58,000 tonnes. Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 64% of world uranium production. Other important uranium producing countries are Niger, Namibia, Russia, Uzbekistan, the United States, China, and Malawi.
Uranium from mining is mostly used as fuel for nuclear power plants. Uranium ores are normally processed by grinding the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder consisting of natural uranium, "yellowcake," which is sold on the uranium market as U3O8.
Environment.
In 1950, the US Public Health service began a comprehensive study of uranium miners, leading to the first publication of a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining, released in 1962. The federal government eventually regulated the standard amount of radon in mines, setting the level at 0.3 WL on January 1, 1969.
Out of 50 present and former uranium milling sites in 12 states, 24 have been abandoned, and are the responsibility of the US Department of Energy. Accidental releases from uranium mills include the 1979 Church Rock uranium mill spill in New Mexico, called the largest accident of nuclear-related waste in US history, and the 1986 Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release in Oklahoma.
In 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), granting reparations for those affected by mining, with amendments passed in 2000 to address criticisms with the original act.
Economics.
As of July 2014, the price of uranium concentrate remained near a five-year low, the uranium price having fallen more than 50% from the peak price in January 2011, and reflecting loss of Japanese demand following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Because of continued low prices, in February 2014 mining company Cameco put back plans to expand production from existing Canadian mines, although it continued work to open a new mine at Cigar Lake. Also in February 2014, Paladin energy suspended operations at its mine in Malawi, saying that the high-cost operation was losing money at current prices.

In Mortal Hands

In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age is a 2009 book by Stephanie Cooke. The book says that nuclear energy failed to develop in the way its planners hoped, and explores the military and civilian sides of nuclear energy. In the book, Cooke says that we are not close to solving the nuclear waste problem, and that "the billions spent by government on nuclear over the past sixty years crowded out other energy options". The book suggests that there are practical reasons why nuclear reactors are unlikely to provide a solution to the global climate change problem.
Stephanie Cooke has written about the nuclear industry since the 1980s, and is a contributor to the "Bulletin of Atomic Scientists". There have been many media interviews about "In Mortal Hands".

Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power

Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy is a 2011 book by Benjamin K. Sovacool, published by World Scientific. Sovacool’s book explores the global nuclear power industry, its fuel cycle, nuclear accidents, environmental impacts, social risks, and economics. There is a postscript on the Japanese 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Based on detailed analysis, Sovacool concludes "that a global nuclear renaissance would bring immense technical, economic, environmental, political, and social costs". He says that it is renewable energy technologies which will enhance energy security, and which have many other advantages.
Reviewer Mark Diesendorf says that one weakness of the book is the limited coverage of nuclear weapons proliferation. He says that governments of several countries (e.g., France, India, North Korea, Pakistan) have used nuclear power and/or research reactors to assist nuclear weapons development.

Penthouse

A Penthouse is typically an apartment on the highest floor of an apartment building. It usually takes up less than half of the entire (flat) roof of the building. Originally the word penthouse meant a small building with a sloped roof. The modern use of the word started in the 1920s in America. In the age of skyscrapers the "house" on the roof was called a penthouse. A penthouse can also be commercial space.
Types of penthouses.
Office buildings have penthouse office suites. Another use for a penthouse is as a restaurant or Café. Their position on a top floor of a building allows for scenic views while dining. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City has a penthouse meeting area. A penthouse can also house a studio, such as a photographic studio.
Building codes.
Under some Building codes a penthouse cannot be more than one-third the size of the floor below it. There is no limit to the number of penthouses a building can have. The only limit is the amount of space they can take up (one-third rule). Also, some building codes do not allow mechanical or electrical equipment to count as a penthouse unless they are enclosed by a roof.

They even financed some military campaigns which shows how rich they were. During the Great Northern War of 1700–1721, the Stroganovs gave sizable financial support to the government of Peter the Great. Because of this, Alexander Grigoriyevich, Nikolay Grigoriyevich, and Sergei Grigoriyevich were raised to the rank of baron in 1722 and later to that of Count. The head of the family was called Count Stroganov and his wife Countess Stroganova. Extremely wealthy after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Stroganov family emigrated with the White movement and all family property in Russia was nationalized. Even though they had much political influence they were also merchants in their own right. They were great rivals of the Counts Vorontsov as well as the Counts Sheremetev.

Super battleship is an unofficial class of battleships. It includes the largest types constructed or planned with a displacing of roughly 60,000 tons or more. Only two such battleships were ever made. Many more were planned by several navies of the world before and during the Second World War. Their design included thick armor and large guns. They were thought to be the ideal warships for naval battle. The success of the aircraft carriers compromised their use. Only two were ever built (both by the Japanese Empire). Both were sunk during World War II.

De Havilland Comet

The de Havilland DH 106 Comet was the first production commercial jetliner. The Avro Tudor and Vickers VC.1 Viking was fitted with Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets. It had flown earlier but were experimental models. The jet was made by de Havilland at its Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom headquarters. The prototype first flew on 27 July 1949. It featured an aerodynamically clean design with four de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines buried in the wings. It had a pressurised fuselage. The jet had large square windows. It showed signs of being a commercial success at its 1952 debut.
The original Comet was about the length of the later Boeing 737-100. It carried fewer people in a more comfortable environment. For the era, it offered a relatively quiet passenger cabin. The Comet had passengers like Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. Flights on the Comet were faster than on other advanced aircraft. In August 1953 BOAC scheduled nine-stop London to Tokyo flights by Comet for 36 hours. Other aircrafts took more than 86 hours. A special order Comet for the exclusive use of King Saud bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia was described as "the world's first executive jet". 
In 1954, the Comets began suffering problems, with three of them breaking up during mid-flight in accidents. During its service, the Comet was involved in 13 fatal crashes which resulted in 426 fatalities. On 10 January 1954, the first Comet produced broke up in mid-air and crashed into the Mediterranean. All 35 persons on board died. On 8 April 1954, a Comet on charter to South African Airways crashed in the Mediterranean near Naples. All on board died. 
The Comet was removed from service and tested to discover the cause. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square windows were noted. As a result, the Comet was redesigned into models 2, 3, and in 1958 the Comet 4. But meanwhile other aircraft designers had their own jets, the Boeing 707 in 1957 and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. In 1960, as part of a consolidation of the British aerospace industry, de Havilland was bought by Hawker Siddeley. Aviation author Bill Withun concluded that the Comet had pushed "'state-of-the-art' beyond its limits." The only complete remaining Comet 1 is displayed at the RAF Museum Cosford.

Longwave

In radio, longwave (or long wave) refers to parts of the radio spectrum that has longer wavelengths. These are typically kilometer-sized or greater. The term is a historic one dating from the early 20th century. This was when the radio spectrum was considered to consist of long, medium and short wavelengths. Most modern radio systems and devices use wavelengths which would then have been considered 'ultra-short'. In modern usage, the term longwave is not defined precisely. Its meaning varies across the world. The most common definition is the radio band with wavelengths greater than 1000 meters (frequencies less than 300 kHz), In Europe, Africa and large parts of Asia this term means the same as AM broadcasting. In the United States longwave is used for beacons, Navigation and weather broadcasting.

<doc id="469488" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=469488" title="Breakbeat">
Breakbeat

Breakbeat (also called breaks or breakbeats) refers to two things. It is both an electronic music genre and the distinct percussive rhythm from which this genre takes its name.
Early history.
As a musical device, breakbeats have been known and used for almost a hundred years. The name and modern meaning of the term traces its origins to the rise of hip hop in the United States during the 1980s. The electronic music genre is widely regarded as coming from the United Kingdom's early rave music. Breakbeats were added to the music to form what became known as breakbeat hardcore. However, breakbeats had been used by American hip hop DJs and turntablists in instrumental sets well before the advent of rave in the UK. It could be argued that the two scenes developed in parallel.
Today, breakbeat lives on in the form of strong regional scenes in the US and UK. Breakbeats are frequently used in the production of such diverse music genres as hip hop, jungle or drum and bass, hardcore, UK garage (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep). Since the 1990s, breakbeat has been used as background music to TV adverts. It also has been used in action film soundtracks.
Etymology.
The most likely origin of the word "breakbeat" is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a "break" in the music. a
In the early 1990s, acid house artists and producers started using breakbeat samples in their music to create breakbeat hardcore. This was also calledrave music. The hardcore scene then diverged into sub-genres like jungle and drum and bass, which generally had a darker sound and focused more on complex sampled drum patterns. An example of this is Goldie's album "Timeless".
Evolution.
In the 1980s, breakbeat became an essential feature of many genres of breaks music which became popular within the global dance music scene, including big beat, nu skool breaks, acid breaks and Miami bass.
DJs from a variety of genres work breaks tracks into their sets. This may occur because the tempo of breaks tracks (ranging from 110 to 150 beats per minute) means they can be readily mixed with these genres.
Some artists well known for breakbeat include Afrika Bambaataa, Whodini, Davy DMX, Deekline, Dynamix II, 2 Live Crew, Cybotron, Nubreed, Hybrid, Phil K, Dirty Harry, NAPT, DJ Icey, Stanton Warriors, , Krafty Kuts, Freestylers, K-Swing, Soul Of Man, DJ Sharaz, Annie Nightingale and performance troupe Lucent Dossier Experience.
Breakbeats are used in many hip hop, jungle and hardcore songs. It can also be heard in other music, from popular music to background music in car, and jean commercials on the radio or TV.
The "Amen Break".
The Amen Break, a drum break from The Winstons' song "Amen, Brother" is widely regarded as one of the most widely used and sampled breaks among music using breakbeats. This break was first used on "King of the Beats" by Mantronix, and has since been used in thousands of songs. Other popular breaks are from James Brown's "Funky Drummer" (1970) and "Give it Up or Turnit a Loose", The Incredible Bongo Band's 1973 cover of The Shadows' "Apache", and Lyn Collins' 1972 song "Think (About It)".
Legal issues.
With the rise in popularity of breakbeat music and the advent of digital audio samplers, enterprising companies started selling "breakbeat packages" for the express purpose of helping artists create breakbeats. A breakbeat kit CD would contain many breakbeat samples from different songs and artists, often without the artist's permission or even knowledge. One example of this is the Amen Break, from a song by The Winstons, who hold the copyright. However, a company named Zero-G Limited released a "jungle construction kit" containing hundreds of audio samples. One appeared to be an exact copy of the Amen break. It was slightly sped up. Zero-G Limited claimed copyright since a copyright symbol was included on the product's packaging. However, when it came to Zero-G Limited's notice that there may be another claim on the copyright of the audio sample in question, they removed it from the product. The Winstons have not received royalties for third-party use of samples of the break recorded on their original music release.
Subgenres.
Big beat.
 relarticle mainpage">Main : Big beat
Big beat is a term employed since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe much of the music by artists such as The Prodigy, Cut La Roc, Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method and Propellerheads. 
Acid breaks.
In electronic music, "acid breaks" is a fusion between breakbeat, acid, acid techno and other forms of electronic dance music (EDM). 
 
 
[] Its drum line usually mimics most breakbeat music, lacking the distinctive kick drum of other forms of EDM. One of the earliest synthesizers to be employed in acid music was the Roland TB-303. 
In more recent times, artists such as have started a resurgence of this sound, using mainly Amen breaks, Reese bass, and 303 acid lines to create energetic, and sometimes frenetic acid breaks songs.

Reviews.
Kathy Parsons in a review at MonthlyPiano.com states while reviewing the piece, "Whereas", "I heard some of these pieces live a few months ago, but even that didn’t prepare me for the soulful beauty of the recording." Parsons also stated in the review that, "The thirteen original piano solos are Oswald’s creative response to a gift of unpublished personal poems that express “the joy of unity, the sorrow of separation, the desire to know and be known, the bliss of loving and being loved. (as she quoted from the liner notes.)
Brett Campbell from the Eugene Weekly CD Review stated the following:
"Eugene-based composer Rebecca Oswald has two of the loveliest pieces on this disc of modern symphonic works performed by several orchestras, in this case the Moravian Philharmonic. Movie directors take note: “Finding the Murray River” could work as a film soundtrack behind on a long pastoral shot of a carriage riding down a country road."

Stoa of Eumenes was a stoa on the Acropolis of Athens. The building was a gift to the city in about 160 BC, by Eumenes II of Pergamon. Today there are ruins of the stoa at the south part of the Acropolis, between the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and the Theatre of Dionysus. The stoa was found by the "Archaeological Society of Athens" in the years 1877–1878.
The building.
The stoa is 163 meters (535 ft) long today. New findings suggest that it was about 190 meters (623 ft) long in the past. About 160 BC part of the stoa was destroyed to build the Odeon of Herodes. The stoa was then connected to the Odeon. Vitruvius said that it was there to protect the viewers that waited outside the theater and to store things of the theater. The stoa was built like other buildings of Pergamon. The main material was marble from Asia Minor. Its parts were first built in Pergamon. Then they were transported to Athens. It had doric columns in the ground floor and ionic in the top floor. The columns inside were ionic and pergamine in both floors. The power and wealth of Eumenes' kingdom was growing. Eumenes was trying to expand his influence in the greek cities. So he gave gifts to Greek cities. One of them was his stoa in Athens. Attalus was the brother of Eumenes. He gifted a similar building to Athens, called Stoa of Attalus.

Stoa

Stoas are unique to Ancient Greek architecture. They were covered walkways or porticos, mainly for public use. Early stoas were open at the entrance with columns, usually of the Doric order, lining the side of the building. They were well suited for the mild climate of Greece.
Later buildings of this style had two floors. A roof supported the inner colonnades. On the second floor were shops or offices. They followed Ionic architecture. Merchants could sell their goods. Artists could display their artwork. Religious gatherings could take place. Stoas usually surrounded the marketplaces of large cities.

Formosan mountain dog

The Formosan Mountain Dog (or Formosan) is a breed of small or medium dog. They live in Taiwan. These dogs are also known as "Taiwanese Dog/Canis" (Chinese: 台灣犬 
 
), "Taiwanese Native Dog" (Chinese: 台灣土狗 
 
) or "Takasago Dog" (Chinese: 高砂犬 
 
). They are well-adapted to the uneven and thickly forested terrain of Taiwan. They had become a semi-wild breed earlier. 
Formosans can be trained as hunting dogs, guard dogs, rescue dogs, or simply as companions. Formosan dogs can make good family pets but still have a strong hunting instinct.
However, now the pureblood Formosan Mountain Dog is still close to extinction. This is due to limited conservation efforts of the Taiwanese and their government. 
"Native Dog" (Chinese: 土狗 
 
) is the common name in Taiwan nowadays to indicate that the dog is an offspring of Formosan with foreign dogs. It is commonly confused with the "Taiwan Native Dog" (Chinese: 台灣土狗 
 
).

Withdrawal (military)

A military withdrawal or retreat is a type of military operation. It generally means pulling back forces while maintaining contact with the enemy. There are several reasons why a military force would retreat. A force might pull back to occupy ground that is easier to defend. A retreat may be used to lead an enemy into an ambush. It may be moving back as quickly as possible in order to save your army from defeat. A withdrawal or retreat can be risky. It requires discipline to keep forces organized and not turn a retreat into a rout. Care must also be taken so a retreat does not damage a force's morale.
Tactical withdrawal.
A withdrawal may be necessary when a defending force is outmatched or on disadvantageous ground. But it is usually important to cause as much damage to an enemy as possible. In such a case, the retreating force may employ a number of tactics and strategies. These are to slow an enemy's progress. This could include setting mines or booby traps during or before withdrawal. Sometimes ambush by a small force can slow or stop an enemy advance. Also, leading the enemy into prepared artillery barrages, or the use of scorched earth tactics.
Rout.
In warfare, the long term strategy is the defeat of the enemy. An effective tactical method is to demoralize the enemy. This is usually done by defeating their army. This is also done by routing them from the battlefield. Once a force had become disorganized it loses its ability to fight as a unit. The victors can chase down the fleeing soldiers. The victors can also attempt to cause as many casualties as possible. They also may try to take as many prisoners as possible.
However a commander must decide if the advantages of a pursuit is worth the risk the enemy is only pretending to retreat (a "feigned" retreat is an effective tactic).
Feigned retreat.
The act of feigning a withdrawal or rout is to lure an enemy away from a defended position. It may lure them into a prepared ambush. It is an ancient tactic, and has been used throughout the history of warfare.
Two famous examples are:
Occupied withdrawal.
Withdrawal of a military occupation may be due to political reasons. The purpose of 'Troop withdrawal' from occupied lands may not involve engagement with an enemy. It may be conducted during a period of ceasefire or relative peace, as in the cases of Palestine.

Grandee of Spain

The Grandes de España are the highest ranking members of the Spanish nobility. Their ranks are made up of those nobles holding the most important historical landed titles in Spain. In the modern day, many of these titles overlap or are held by the same person. Strategic marriages have collected titles under certain noble houses over time. 
In the modern day, all Grandees have the status 'of the first class'. It implies neither privilege nor power.
An individual is a grandee if he or she holds a "Grandeza de España", regardless of possession of a title of nobility. Normally, each "grandeza" is granted with a title, but this was not always the case. Also, a "Grandeza de España" is normally awarded along with every ducal title. Several members of both Spanish and French nobility were made Grandees also. 
Address.
Grandees and their consorts are entitled to the style of "The Most Excellent" (Spanish: "Excelentísimo Señor" 
 
, male, or "Excelentísima Señora 
 
", female; abbreviated as "Excmo. Sr." or "Excma. Sra."). In written form, their names are followed by the abbreviation G de E.

Retching

Retching (also called dry heaving or gagging) is when the motion of the stomach and esophagus goes backward, but there is no vomiting. It can be caused by bad smells, choking or stopping certain medications. It can also be because of stress.
Retching is different from vomiting. During a retch, pressure in the thorax goes down and pressure in the abdomen goes up. In vomiting, both pressures go up.

Vampire in Brooklyn (also known as Wes Craven's Vampire in Brooklyn) is a 1995 American horror comedy movie. It was directed by Wes Craven and was produced by Eddie Murphy and Mark Lipsky. "Vampire in Brooklyn" was released on October 27, 1995. It was the final movie that was produced under Paramount Pictures since Eddie Murphy's contract ran out.
The movie gained negative reviews from critics and holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Murphy said why Vampire in Brooklyn was a failure. He was quoted as saying "The only way I was able to do "Nutty Professor" and to get out of my Paramount deal, I had to do Vampire in Brooklyn. But you know what ruined that movie? The wig. I walked out in that longhaired wig and people said, 'Oh, get the fuck out of here! What the hell is this?'"

Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: "Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt") is a late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance. It is one of the most notable Arthurian stories. It is known as the "beheading game". 
The story is written in stanzas of alliterative verse. Each stanza ends in a rhyming bob and wheel.
Plot.
At a New Year's Day feast in Camelot, a huge green man rides in on a green horse carrying a large axe. He issues a challenge to any who dares to accept. He challenges any knight to strike him with his axe, if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. 
Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's Round Table, accepts the challenge. Gawain beheads the Green Knight with his blow. Then the Green knight stands up and picks up his head. He says:
Having remined Gawain of the appointed time, the Green Knight rides off. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain sets off on his search. His honour is called into question several times. Gawain avoids several trials on his way. Finally he meets the Lady Bertilak, who tries to seduce him. He avoids this, but accepts a gift from her. He is bound to give the gift back to his host (who actually is the Green Knight in another form). When the day comes for the Green Knight to strike, Gawain kneels... When the Green Knight strikes, he nicks Gawain's neck, but otherwise Gawain is unhurt. The Green Knight explains that the nick is payment for Gawain's only fault, keeping the small gift.
The Green Knight is thought by some to be the Green Man of folklore, and by others to represent Satan.

Reception theory

Reception theory is a theory proposed by Stuart Hall. Its main principal is that a text can have different meanings to different audiences. It is also called "reader response theory". The reader (or viewer) contributes to a text by interpreting it to what they think it says. This interpretation, or understanding, is a product of the whole audience reading or viewing it, not just individuals. How an audience receives a text can sometimes be radically different from how it was intended to be received.

Uses and gratifications theory

The Uses and gratifications theory is a theory by Blumer and Katz. It states that different people watch television and movies for different reasons.
There may be somebody who will watch a romantic comedy so that they can put themselves in the shoes of the characters and feel love. Somebody may watch "Breaking Bad" so that they can join in with social conversation relating to that topic. It may be said that you would watch a television for escapism so that you forget the stress or normal life.

Hypodermic needle model

The hypodermic needle model (also known as the magic bullet theory or the direct effects model) is an early theory of mass communications. The theory stated that the mass media had direct influence over audiences by "injecting" their minds with information. According to this theory media messages are powerful forces and audiences are powerless to resist them. The theory was popular during the 1940s and 1950s. Ideas about the power of the mass media were based on historical events. One was the role played by the Hearst Newspapers in getting public support for the Spanish-American War. Another was the powerful Nazi propaganda campaigns by Joseph Goebbels in World War II. Still another was the idea of a powerful Madison Avenue advertising influence on consumer buying and voting. Later researchers determined the theory was just too simple and too general to be accurate.
Most modern media scholars think the theory is mostly false. However, many Americans still believe the mass media has unlimited power to control people's minds. In effect they believe the myth that if the mass media tells people to jump, the only question will be how high.
