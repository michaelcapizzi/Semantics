Source engine

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
The Source engine is a video game engine created by a company called Valve Corporation.
The engine made its first appearance in 2004 with a game called , and was also included in Half-Life 2. Source has been worked on since that date, and is included in many of Valve's games.
Source is meant to power first person shooter video games, but has also been used to create other types of video games as well.
Features.
A full list of features can be found at 
Criticism.
Source SDK.
The Source SDK has been criticized for being out of date and hard to use.
Origins.
The Source engine originated from the GoldSrc, which was a changed version of John D. Carmack's Quake engine.
Caramack said on his blog in 2004 that there's "still bits of Quake code in Half-Life 2".
Valve worker Erik Johnson explains the origins of the GoldSrc engine on the Valve Developer Community:
 When we were getting very close to releasing "Half-Life" (less than a week or so), we found there were already some projects that we needed to start working on, but we couldn't risk checking in code to the shipping version of the game. At that point we forked off the code in VSS to be both codice_2 and codice_3. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as "Goldsource" and "Source". At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was currently released, and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show "Half-Life 2" for the first time at E3, it was part of our internal communication to refer to the "Source" engine vs. the "Goldsource" engine, and the name stuck.
The Source engine then continued to replace the GoldSrc engine, until Source was mostly used at Valve.
Valve Developer Community.
In 2005, Valve launched a website called the Valve Developer Community, which told users how to use the Source engine.

Richard Taylor (general)

Richard Taylor (January 27, 1826 – April 12, 1879) was an American plantation owner, politician, military historian, and Confederate general in the American Civil War. He was born in 1826 in Kentucky. His father was Zachary Taylor, who was a U.S. general and later a U.S. president. Richard Taylor graduated from Yale University in 1845. When his father died in 1851, he inherited a sugar cane plantation in Louisiana.
When the Civil War started, he became colonel of the 9th Louisiana Infantry. He fought in Virginia. He became a brigadier general in October 1861. In July 1862, he became a major general. After that, he was made the commander of the District of West Louisiana. He fought against several Union armies trying to invade western Louisiana, including during the Red River Campaign in 1864.
While he was in western Louisiana, Taylor often disagreed with Edmund Kirby Smith. Smith commanded the Confederates west of the Mississippi River. Because they disagreed so often, Taylor was sent east of the Mississippi in April 1864. He commanded Confederates in Mississippi and Alabama until the end of the war in May 1865.
Taylor died in 1879 in New York City.

Samuel Adams is an American brand of beer. It is brewed by the Boston Beer Company (NYSE: ) and its associated contract brewers. The company was founded in 1984 by Jim Koch, Harry M. Rubin, and Lorenzo Lamadrid in Boston, Massachusetts. The brand name of Samuel Adams (often abbreviated to Sam Adams, even in advertisements), was chosen in honor of Samuel Adams, an American patriot. Samuel Adams was famous for his role in the American Revolution and the Boston Tea Party. According to tradition, he was also a maltster. However, James Koch, founder of the Boston Beer Company, reports having seen a receipt for hops signed by Samuel Adams. This seems to indicate the patriot Adams may have done some brewing. Based on sales in 2011, the Boston Beer Company is tied with Yuengling for the largest American-owned beer-maker.

Japanese idol

An idol (アイドル, aidoru, from the English word "idol") 
 
 in the Japanese pop culture is a young media personality (a singer, an actor, a model, etc.). This is usually a teenager, who has a cute and innocent public image. Idols are a separate category of Japanese artists.
The term is commercialized by Japanese talent agents. The talent agencies hold auditions for cute boys and girls and make them stars. Idols are intended to be an ideal object of love of frenzied fans. There is also a view that the Japanese people see idols as sisters or girls next door.
Japanese idol singers work across genres of the Japanese pop music. This is usually whatever is most popular at the moment. Their songs do not require great singing skills, but the artist must be beautiful, sweet and nice to sing them. In their everyday life, idols must also match the songs they sing. They must have a perfect public image and be good examples to young people.
History.
The phenomenon appeared in the early 1970s. It was thanks to the popularity of young French actress Sylvie Vartan and the movie she played in called "Cherchez l'idole" ("Look for the Idol"). The movie came out in Japan in November 1964 under the title "Aidoru o Sagase". The term "idol" started being used for girls, mostly between 14 and 16, who were just beginning their path to stardom or for very young new stars.

The Protopopovs

Oleg Protopopov and Ludmila Belousova (often called "The Protopopovs") are former Russian figure skaters. They skated for the Soviet Union. They won Olympic gold medals in 1964 and 1968. They won the World Figure Skating Championships every year from 1965 to 1968.
In 1979, Protopopov and Belousova defected to Switzerland. They became Swiss citizens in 1995. They continued to skate at ice shows and skating exhibitions through their seventies.
Career.
Protopopov and Belousova met in Moscow in 1954. They trained in Leningrad.
They competed internationally for the Soviet Union. Their first coach was Igor Moskvin. Their second coach was Petr Orlov. After some disagreements, they left Orlov. They then trained without a coach at a rink in Voskresensk, Moscow Oblast. In 1961, they decided to work with Stanislav Zhuk to raise their technical difficulty.
The Protopopovs' first competition was at the 1958 World Championships. They finished in 13th place. At the 1960 Winter Olympics, they finished in 9th place. In 1962, they won the silver medal at the World Championships. They were the first pair from the Soviet Union or Russia to win a world medal in their sport. They also won silver at the 1962 European Figure Skating Championships. 
The Protopopovs' won their first major international gold medal at the 1964 Winter Olympics. It was the first Olympic pairs gold for the Soviet Union. From this Olympic Games to the 2006 Winter Olympics, only Soviet/Russian skaters won gold medals in pairs skating. That was the longest streak in Olympic history.
The Protopopovs won their first World and European gold medals in 1965. They were the first Soviet/Russian pair to win those. 
They won Olympic gold medals for the second time at the 1968 Winter Olympics. At 32 and 35 years old, they were some of the oldest champions in figure skating.
In 1969 they won the silver medal at the European Championships and the bronze medal at the World Championships. Those were their last major international competitions. They continued to compete within the Soviet Union until 1972. After retiring from competition, they skated in shows into their seventies.
The Protopopovs contributed to the development of pairs skating. They created three kinds of the figure skating move called "death spiral". Dick Button said, "The Protopopovs are great skaters not only because they were the finest of Olympic champions, but also because their creative impact was extraordinary."
Personal life.
Belousova and Protopopov married in December 1957. They are usually called "The Protopopovs", even though Belousova kept her maiden name after their marriage. They decided not to have children because they wanted to keep skating.
On 24 September 1979, Belousova and Protopopov defected to Switzerland while on tour. They applied for political asylum. They settled in Grindelwald. They became Swiss citizens in 1995. Switzerland is still their winter home. Their summer home and training center is in Lake Placid, New York. On 25 February 2003, they went back to Russia for the first time. They were invited by Vyacheslav Fetisov, the Russian Minister of Sport.

Lossy compression

Lossy compression is a form of data compression where parts of the data are lost in the process. When a compressed data is returned to normal some data is lost. Lossy compression is used to greatly reduce the size of a computer file when it is stored, handled, or transmitted. As an example, JPEG is a lossy compression format. GIF and PNG are lossless compression systems. Other lossy compression systems are MP3 for sound files and WMV for video. If the compression were to be taken too far, it would cause a noticeable change in the file.

Toba catastrophe

The Toba catastrophe was the largest volcanic eruption in the last 2.6 million years. It is called a catastrophe because its effects may have damaged the human species. 
The eruption.
Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia, is the site of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred 73,000 (±4000 years) years ago.
It was a climate-changing event. The eruption was two orders of magnitude (= x100) larger than the largest known historic eruption, that of Tambora, also in Indonesia.
This eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of Toba during the Quaternary epoch. It had an estimated Volcanic Explosivity Index of 8 (described as "apocalyptic"). It made a sizable contribution to the 100x30 km caldera complex. The mass it threw out was 100 times greater than the largest volcanic eruption in recent history. That was the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which caused the 1816 "Year Without a Summer" in the northern hemisphere.
Consequences.
The eruption of Toba led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide decline in temperatures between 3-5 degrees C, and up to 15 degrees C in higher latitudes.
Effect on humans.
According to the Toba catastrophe theory,it had global consequences, killing most humans then alive and creating a population bottleneck in Central Eastern Africa and India that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today. 
According to the theory, only 10,000 (perhaps only 1,000) pairs of humans survived the disaster. Perhaps it led to the other hominids becoming extinct, though the Neanderthals certainly survived in Europe and Eurasia. 
There is no direct evidence that the theory is correct. And there is no evidence for any other animal decline or extinction, even in environmentally sensitive species. There is evidence that human habitation continued in India after the eruption. The theory in its strongest form seems to be incorrect.

County Armagh

County Armagh is one of six counties that together make up Northern Ireland. It is also one of the 32 counties of Ireland. County Armagh lies in the north-east of the island of Ireland. The county is 1,326 km² big. About 174,792 people live there.
The county is named after the town Armagh. The name "Armagh" derives from the Irish word "Ard" meaning "high place" and "Macha". In stories, Macha is a goddess of Ireland. Armagh was the main town for the historic Ulaid kings of Ulster.
Landscape.
The landscape has hills in the south. Slieve Gullion is the highest mountain. It goes down from there and becomes flatter with small hills called drumlins in the middle and the west. It is fairly flat in the north, and is at sea level at Lough Neagh. There are a few small islands in the lake.
History.
Ancient Armagh was the territory of the Ulaid people before the year 400. The Red Branch ruled the county. Their capital was a fort called Emain Macha near Armagh. The Red Branch play an important role in the stories in the Ulster Cycle. They are also part of the story the "Cattle Raid of Cooley". 
Armagh was the Roman Catholic home of Saint Patrick.
The Troubles.
South Armagh is mostly nationalist. This means that there is a lot of support for the IRA there. 
Baronies.
"Baronies" are old divisions of Ireland. Below is a list of the baronies in County Armagh.
Transport.
Two major highways run through County Armagh. The M1 links Belfast to Dungannon in the north of the county. The A1/N1 from Belfast to Dublin runs in the far south east. Armagh has lots of local roads connecting the towns and villages.
There used to be many railways in County Armagh, but at the moment there are only a few stations left. 
Ulsterbus is the bus company that runs most public transport in the county. It includes buses from most towns to Belfast. Railway companies Northern Ireland Railways and Iarnród Éireann together run the Enterprise service. It has trains that go to Dublin (about an hour) and Belfast (about forty minutes) a few times daily. There are many more Northern Ireland Railways trains into Belfast and Bangor.
Inland waterways.
The Ulster Canal and the Newry Canal run through County Armagh. The canals are not fully open for boats to use.

Hyaenodont

The Hyaenodontidae ("Hyaena teeth") is a family of the extinct order Creodonta, which contains several dozen genera.
The Hyaenodonts were important mammalian predators that arose during the late Paleocene and persisted well into the Miocene. They were more widespread and successful than their sister family, the oxyaenids.
General characteristics.
They had long skulls, slender jaws, slim bodies, and a tendency to walk on their toes rather than flat-footed (plantigrade). They ranged in size from 30 to 140 cm at the shoulder. "Hyaenodon gigas", the larger species, was as much as 1.4 m high at the shoulder, 10 feet long and weighed about 500 kg, but most were in the 5–15 kg range, equivalent to a mid-sized dog. Fossil evidence of their skulls shows that they had a particularly acute sense of smell, while their teeth were adapted for shearing, rather than crushing.
Teeth.
Their lack of crushing teeth means they could not crush the bones of any but the smallest prey. This contrasts with modern hyaenas, which can crush bones of larger prey. This gives then a good source of calcium, and access to the highly nutritious bone marrow. Modern bears and dogs also have bone-crushing capability, though not to the same extent as hyaenas. Hyaenodonts thus thus lacked dental versatility for processing any foods other than meat.
The carnassials in a hyaenodontid are generally the second upper and third lower molars. However, some hyaenodontids had as many as three pairs of carnassials or carnassial-like molar teeth in their jaws. 
Life-style.
Because of their size range, it is probable that different species hunted in different ways and allowed them to fill many different predatory niches. Smaller ones would hunt in packs during the night like wolves, and bigger, fiercer ones would hunt alone during the daylight, using their sheer size and their mighty jaws as their principal weapon.

Methanogen

Methanogens are microorganisms which produce methane as a metabolic byproduct in anoxic conditions. They are archaea, a different domain from bacteria. They are common in wetlands, where they are responsible for marsh gas. 
They are also common in the digestive tracts of many animals, such as ruminants and humans. They are responsible for the methane content of belching in ruminants and flatulence in humans. 
In marine sediments methane is produced when sulfates are depleted, below the top layers. Moreover, the methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments. Others are extremophiles, found in environments such as hot springs and submarine hydrothermal vents as well as in the "solid" rock of the Earth's crust, kilometers below the surface. 
Methanogens can convert acetic acid to methane in a fermentation process. Do not confuse them with methanotrophs, which use up methane for their carbon and energy requirements.

Selfie

A selfie is a self-portrait photograph. It is typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone. 
Selfies are often shared on social networking services such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr. They are often casual, and are typically taken either with a camera held at arm's length or in a mirror. Some people use a "selfie stick" to hold the camera.
One of the first self-portraits was taken in 1839 by Robert Cornelius, an American photographer. The term "selfie" was first used by photographer Jim Krause in 2005.
Selfies by animals.
A black crested macaque ("Macaca nigra") snatched a camera, and took a photo of herself. The selfie seemed to establish a legal precedent when the Wikimedia Foundation rejected a copyright claim. The ground was that a non-human could not own a copyright, and the camera owner had not taken the photo, and so also could not own the copyright. Therefore the photo was not under copyright.

Tom's Rhinoplasty

"Tom's Rhinoplasty" is the eleventh episode of the first season of "South Park". It was first shown on Comedy Central in the United States on February 11, 1998. The episode was the series' first Valentine's Day episode. It was written by the show's co-creator Trey Parker.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that they were originally not happy with the final product and they thought that fans of the show would hate. They were surprised that fans responded positively to it.
Plot.
When Valentine's Day approaches, Wendy suggests to her boyfriend Stan ways to try and spend time together. After their schoolteacher Mr. Garrison decides to get a rhinoplasty, he introduces their new substitute teacher, Ms. Ellen (voiced by Natasha Henstridge). The boys in class fall in love with her, including Stan, especially when she talks to him. This makes Wendy become incredibly jealous and she warns Ms. Ellen to stay away from Stan, oblivious to the fact that Ms. Ellen does not return Stan's affection. 
When Ms. Ellen becomes worried about the student's education, she says that the winner of a spelling test will be bought a dinner. The boys attempt to date Ms. Ellen but Chef tells them that she is a lesbian and that she only likes other lesbians. They don't know what this means and they try to become lesbians themselves to try and attract Ms. Ellen. They try wearing Birkenstocks, listening to an Indigo Girls album and "licking carpet" (they mistake this for literally licking the carpet floor).
Meanwhile Mr. Garrison's gets a nose job that makes him one of the most attractive men in South Park with his face resembling David Hasselhoff. He decides to quit teaching and try to pursue women. Stan is able to win the spelling test and the dinner but he finds out that Ms. Ellen has no attraction or intention of making love with him. The next day, while Ms. Ellen is teaching the class, several Iraqi men burst through the door and say that she is actually an Iraqi fugitive. She resist her arrest but accidentally kills Kenny by impaling him in the face with a sword. They take her into custody and shoot her into the sun with a rocket. 
Mr. Garrison later becomes a model with great success, but he finds himself being chased throughout the streets by a large group of women and doesn't want the attention. He returns to Tom's Rhinoplasty and regains his original look. Wendy speaks fluent Arabic to a group of Iraqi men and pays them with with a wad of American money. She then watches happily in the sky as the rocket gets blown up in the sun. Kyle realizes that Wendy hired the Iraqi men to murder Ms. Ellen and Wendy says "I told her: 'Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!'" as the episode ends.

Apomorphy

An apomorphy in biology is a derived state, or innovation. For example, amongst mammals, babies can digest their mothers' milk. That is something all mammals share. It is an apomorphy unique to mammals, and so is the production of milk by mammalian mothers.
Apomorphies which are found in every species of a group of animals are the basis of taxonomy. If a group of animals all have a unique apomorphy, the most likely reason is that they descended from a common ancestor. When a group of animals share a large number of apomorphies this becomes a near-certainty. Mammals share a long list of characters which are unique to them.
Clades are identified (or defined) by synapomorphies (from syn-, "together"). These are a group of apomorphies which they all have, but other groups do not. For example, the five digits (fingers and toes) like ours is a synapomorphy within the vertebrates. The tetrapods are the first vertebrates with such digits. Snakes and other tetrapods which do not have digits are tetrapods because other characters, such as amniotic eggs and diapsid skulls, show they descended from ancestors that which had digits.

Crappie

The crappies ( or ) are a genus, "Pomoxis", of North American freshwater fish. They are members of the sunfish family Centrarchidae. Both species in this genus are popular game fish. These are the Black crappie and the White crappie. The White crappie is the state fish of Louisiana.
Etymology.
The genus name "Pomoxis" comes from the Greek πώμα (cover, plug, operculum) and οξύς (sharp). The common name (also spelled croppie or crappé), comes from the Canadian French "crapet," which refers to many different fishes of the sunfish family. Other names for crappie are papermouths, strawberry bass, speckled bass or specks (especially in Michigan), speckled perch, calico bass (throughout New England), "sac-a-lait" (in southern Louisiana, lit. "milk bag", a rendition of Choctaw "sakli") and Oswego bass.
Species.
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
Biology.
Crappies are both preditors and prey. Both species of crappie as adults feed predominantly on smaller fish species. This includes the young of their own predators (which include the northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye). They have varied diets, however, including zooplankton, insects, and crustaceans. By day, crappie tend to be less active and to concentrate around weed beds or submerged objects, such as logs and boulders. They feed especially at dawn and dusk, moving then into open water or approaching the shore. 
There are differences between the White and Black crappies. White crappies have 5 or 6 dorsal spines while Black crappies have 7 or 8. White crappies are usually more numerous and tend to be larger. Black crappies appear darker because of the dark spots on its sides. White crappies have black vertical bands on their bodies and are often lighter in color. But the two can be difficult to tell apart unless you count the spines. Crappies are among the most numerous in North American waters. Black crappies begin spawning when the water temperature reaches 60 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Females lay between 20,000 and 140,000 eggs. The White crappies begin spawning at water temperatures between 65 and 70 degrees F. The female White crappie lays between 1,000 and 200,000 eggs. Male crappies guard the nest until the eggs hatch, usually in about five days.
Game fish.
The "Pomoxis" species are highly regarded game fishes and are often considered to be among the best-tasting freshwater fish. Because of the variety of their diets, crappies may be caught in many ways. This includs casting light jigs, trolling with minnows or artificial lures. Small spinnerbaits, or using bobbers are also very effective. Crappies are very popular with ice-fishermen, as they are active in winter. The current all-tackle fishing world record for a black crappie is 2.25 kg and for a white crappie is 2.35 kg. 
Angling.
Angling for crappies is popular throughout much of North America. Methods vary, but among the most popular is called "Spider Rigging," a method characterized by a fisherman in a boat with many long fishing rods pointing away from the angler at various angles like spokes from a wheel. Anglers who employ the Spider Rigging method may choose from among many popular baits, like corn. Many anglers also chum or dump live bait into the water to attract the fish hoping the fish will bite their bait. There are many types of lures that catch crappies. Jigs, especially with a live minnow are very effective. Spoons, Spinners and Crankbaits are all effective at different times.
Commercial fishing.
A commercial fishery for crappies existed at Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee until 2003. It was one of the few commercial fisheries for crappies.

Ryan Higa (also known by his YouTube username nigahiga) is an American YouTube celebrity, actor, comedian, and producer. He moved to Las Vegas to study filmmaking at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Higa's videos are either solo efforts or videos with other people. He's known for his YouTube comedy videos. They have been viewed over 1.7 billion times. s of 2014[ [update]], Higa's YouTube channel has over 12 million subscribers.
Background.
Higa was born in Hilo, Hawaii on June 6, 1990. He holds a black belt in Judo. He also wrestled, and graduated from Waiakea High School in 2008.
Higa's YouTube videos.
Higa and Fujiyoshi Sean started posting YouTube videos of themselves lip-synching to songs in mid-2006 while attending Waiakea High School. They quickly expanded beyond songs, with a variety of other comedic pieces. Occasional guest appearances were made by Enos Tim, Villaruel Ryan, Chun Kyle, and Nago Tarynn.
On Christmas Eve of 2008, Higa and Fujiyoshi's two most popular videos, "How To Be Gangster" and "How To Be Emo", were removed due to copyright violations. On January 21, 2009, the nigahiga account was temporarily suspended and was required to remove more copyrighted videos. Because of this, nigahiga's lip synching videos were all removed (with the exception of "You're Beautiful", which was audio swapped), along with most of his other videos that included copyrighted music. Since then, Higa started composing the music himself. "How to be Gangster" and "How to be Emo" were put back on nigahiga's channel in late August 2009, only to be removed a few days later, along with "How to be Ninja" and "How to be Nerd". In Spring 2010, "How to be Ninja", "How to be Gangster" and "How to be Emo" were made public once more.
Due to Higa Ryan moving to Las Vegas for college, most of the nigahiga videos are solo efforts. They usually feature collaborations with other users.
Channels.
The nigahiga YouTube channel was created on July 20, 2006 by Higa Ryan, Fujiyoshi Sean, Enos Tim, and Nago Tarynn (known collectively as "The Yabo Crew"). By December 21, 2010, it had reached 3 million subscribers, the first channel to do so. According to Higa, his channel name is a combination of "Niga", which means "rant" in Japanese, and his last name, "Higa".
He created a second channel, under the name HigaTV, in 2011, where he posts video blogs and behind the scenes movies. In May 2014, it had over 2.1 million subscribers.
In 2012, Higa helped form the YOMYOMF Network, which hosts the online video-making talent competition, "Internet Icon", of which he serves alongside Lakin Christine and DeLaGhetto Timothy as main judges.

Centrarchidae or sunfish are a family of freshwater ray-finned fish. They belonging to the order Perciformes. The type genus is "Centrarchus" (consisting solely of the flier, "C. macropterus"). The family's 37 species include many fish familiar to North Americans, including the rock bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and crappies. All are native only to North America. Family members are distinguished by having from five to 13 dorsal spines number. Sizes of most are in the 20 to range. However, some are much smaller, with the black-banded sunfish at just 8 cm in length, while the largemouth bass is reported to reach almost 1 m in extreme cases.
The male of most species builds a nest by hollowing out a depression using his tail, then guards the eggs. Most sunfish are valued for sport fishing. They have been introduced in many areas outside their original ranges, sometimes becoming an invasive species.

Von Neumann architecture

Von Neumann architecture or the von Neumann model is an early computer design description. It was written by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann and others in the "First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC".
It describes a design an electronic digital computer. There are subsections of a processing unit with an arithmetic logic unit, processor registers, a control unit with an instruction register and program counter, memory to store data and instructions, and input and output devices. 
This means a stored-program computer. It has an "instruction fetch", the step getting the instruction from memory, and a data operation, the instruction actually happening. These cannot be done at the same time because they use the same bus. This limit is called the von Neumann bottleneck. 
Early von Neumann computers.
These are some examples of von Neumann model computers.
Evolution.
Through the 1960s and 1970s computers became smaller and faster, leading to improvements in the design. This is sometimes called "streamlining" the design. 
Von Neumann bottleneck.
The common bus used by the program memory and data memory creates what is called the von Neumann bottleneck, which is the limit of the data transfer rate between the CPU and memory. Because the program and data cannot be accessed at the same time, the data transfer rate is smaller than the rate the CPU can work, limiting the effective processing speed of the CPU. It is made to wait for the data it needs to be moved to or from memory.

Home for the Holidays (movie)

Home for the Holidays is a 1995 comedy-drama movie directed by Jodie Foster. It tells the story of an unhappy family who are getting together for the Thanksgiving holidays. The comedy scene of the Thanksgiving dinner took more than ten days to make. In all, 64 turkeys, 20 pounds of mashed potatoes, 35 pounds of stuffing, 44 pies, 30 pounds of sweet potatoes, 18 bags of mini-marshmallows and 50 gallons of fake wine were used.
Foster let Robert Downey Jr. improvise some of his role instead of using a script. This got him excited about making movies again. He had been unhappy and tired of acting for a while.
Plot.
Claudia Larson is a single mom with a teenage daughter. Claudia has just lost her job as a museum artist who restores paintings. Even though she is sick with a cold, she flies home to spend Thanksgiving with her parents, Adele and Henry Larson. But her daughter, Kitt is staying home to be with her boyfriend. Kitt tells her mom on the telephone that she is going to have sex with her boyfriend for the first time. 
Claudia's stuck-up and critical sister, Joanne Larson Wedman, is also visiting for dinner. She brings her husband, Walter, and their two spoiled children. Claudia's gay brother, Tommy, and his new friend Leo Fish come, along with their eccentric Aunt Glady.
Tommy has been the boyfriend of another man, Jack, for a long time. So Claudia is confused because he is at dinner with Leo. But, as Claudia finds out, Leo has come along for the holidays to be introduced to Claudia. In fact, Tommy has just recently married Jack. The Thanksgiving day has many crazy events, including a loud fight on the lawn and the spilling of the turkey in Joanne's lap. Even though Claudia is still discouraged, she becomes close to Leo. When she gets on the plane to go home, Leo goes with her.

The first time was in the Reichskrieg's War of 1311. The second time was by the city-state of Reutlingen in 1381. The castle was not rebuilt and became a ruin.
In 1802, King Frederick I of Württemberg built a hunting lodge there. In 1837, the land passed to his nephew Duke Wilhelm of Urach, Count of Württemberg. He added the current castle in 1840–42.
Today, the castle is still owned by the Dukes of Urach. It is open to visitors. The castle has a large collection of historic weapons and armour.

Qianzhousaurus

Qianzhousaurus is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs. So far only one species has been named: the type species "Qianzhousaurus sinensis". Nicknamed 'Pinocchio rex' for its long snout in comparison to other known tyrannosaurs, it was discovered in southern China and first published in the journal "Nature Communications" in May 2014. 
Apart from its signature snout, it also had long, narrow teeth, while "T. rex" had thick teeth and powerful, deep-set jaws. This suggest its feeding method and probably its life-style were quite different from "Tyrannosaurus". The thinner teeth and lighter skeleton of "Qianzhousaurus" suggest it hunted smaller creatures, such as lizards and feathered dinosaurs.
The bones were discovered by workmen at a construction site near the city of Ganzhou, who then took them to a local museum.
The discovery of "Qianzhousaurus", and "Alioramus" from Mongolia, shows that the long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widespread in Asia. Although we are only starting to learn about them, they were apparently one of the main groups of predatory dinosaurs in Asia. Their existence was previously suspected because of various scattered fossil finds. An expert says the find "tells us pretty unequivocally that these long-snouted tyrannosaurs were a real thing. They were a different breed, living right to the end of the age of dinosaurs".

Lactation

Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the breasts when a mother feeds her young. It occurs with almost almost all female mammals after the birth of their young. In humans the process is also called "breastfeeding" or "nursing". 
In most species, milk comes out of the mother's nipples. The platypus (a non-placental or monotreme mammal) releases milk through ducts in its abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat, is milk production a normal male function.
Milk production requires the hormones prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin.
The evolution of milk production made use of a feature which was present before modern mammals. The cells which produce milk were developed from the apocrine glands in the skin: 
Meaning: since the skin of synapsids had glands in it, the development of milk production was possible.
Apart from food nutrients, mothers' milk contains a range of antibodies which protect the baby until it develops its own immune system. When born, a baby has IgG antibodies from across the mother's placenta. Its own immunoglobulin production takes about six months to develop after birth, so meantime the mother's milk supplies IgA as a stop-gap protection.

Alzette

Coordinates: 
The Alzette (Luxembourgish: "Uelzecht" 
 
, German: "Alzig" 
 
) is a river in France and Luxembourg. It is a right tributary of the Sauer river, and so it is part of the drainage basin of the Rhine river.
The Alzette river is sung in "Ons Heemecht", the national anthem of Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: "Wou d'Uelzécht durech d'Wisen zéit..." 
 
, French: "Où l'Alzette arrose champs et prés..." 
 
, German: "Wo die Alzette durch die Wiesen zieht..." 
 
).
Geography.
The Alzette river has a length of 73 km but only 2.7 km of them are in France. Its drainage basin has an area of 1172 km2, most of it in Luxembourg.
Course.
The Alzette has its source in France in the territory of the "commune" of Thil in the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle (Lorraine), at an altitude of about 305 m. It passes through the French "communes" of Villerupt (Luxembourgish: "Weller" 
 
) and Audun-le-Tiche (German: "Deutsch-Oth" 
 
, Luxembourgish: "Däitsch-Oth" 
 
After a few kilometers, the Alzette enters Luxembourg, flowing through the city of Esch-sur-Alzette (Luxembourgish: "Esch-Uelzecht" 
 
, German: "Esch-an-der-Alzette" 
 
 or "Esch-an-der-Alzig", French: "Esch-sur-Alzette" 
 
). At Lameschmillen (near Bergem) it is joined by the Mess river.
It flows on a wide floodplain before getting into a narrow valley near Hesperange. Then it flows through the Luxembourgish cities of Luxembourg (where it is joined by the Pétrusse river) and Mersch (where is joined by the Mamer and Eisch rivers). It joins, as a right tributary, the Sauer river near Ettelbruck, at about 193 m of altitude.
Main tributaries.
The main tributaries of the Alzette rivers are left tributaries; those that join the river by the right side are very small streams.

Table Rock Lake

Table Rock Lake is an artificial lake, or reservoir, in The Ozarks of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas. The lake was made by the construction of Table Rock dam. This 252 foot high impoundment was constructed in 1954-1958 on the White River by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It is one of the popular attractions for the nearby town of Branson, Missouri. There are several commercial marinas along the lake, and Table Rock State Park is located on the east side. Downstream from the dam, the Missouri Department of Conservation operates the Shepherd of the Hills Fish Hatchery, which is used to stock trout in Lake Taneycomo. The cold water from the dam creates an ideal environment for Rainbow trout and Brown trout.
Lake air temperature.
The lake area temperature varies according to season:

Flood control.
The original purpose of the reservoir was for flood control on the White River. It also produces Hydroelectric power and provides recreation for southern Missoui and northern Arkansas. The dam had been authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1941. But World War II and the Korean War delayed construction until 1954. The reservoir has a fluctuation of 16 ft. When the reservoir is above the maximum flood pool, excess water goes over the auxiliary overflow spillway at the north end of the dam. Table Rock is the second of four major reservoirs on the White River before it enters the Mississippi River. The other three are Beaver Lake, Lake Taneycomo and Bull Shoals Lake.
Fishing.
Table Rock is one of the premier Largemouth bass fishing lakes in the United States. All three species of Black bass are here in abundance (Largemouth, Smallmouth and Spotted). The lake has produced Largemouth bass of over 10 pounds and Smallmouth bass over 7 pounds. Table Rock is the site of several major Bass fishing tournaments each year. The lake has several other species of game fish including Crappie, Walleye, White Bass, Paddlefish Catfish and Sunfish. Lake Tannycomo, below Table Rock dam, is one of the top 5 Rainbow and Brown trout fisheries in the world.

Lake Taneycomo

Lake Taneycomo is a man-made lake or reservoir on the White River in the Ozark Mountains of Taney County, Missouri. The reservoir is named for the county in which it is located: Taney County, MO. It flows through the city of Branson, Missouri. Tanycomo is the third of four reservoirs on the White River before it enters the Mississippi River. The other three are Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake and Bull Shoals Lake.
History.
Lake Taneycomo widened out to be a lake with the completion of the Powersite Dam, near Forsyth, Missouri, in 1913. From 1913 until 1958 it was a warm water lake. The United States Army Corps of Engineers completed the Table Rock Dam in 1958. This changed Tanycomo from a warm water lake to a very cold 58 degrees Farenheit (maximum). Gone were the Smallmouth bass the White River was famous for. But it turned Lake Tanycomo into a world class trout fishery. 
In 1957, the Missouri Department of Conservation constructed the Shepherd of the Hills Fish Hatchery. It provides 
between 350,000 and 400,000 pounds of rainbow and brown trout per year, most of which goes into Lake Tanycomo. In 2001, while doing a survey of the lake, Missouri Department of Conservation biologists captured a 36.5 inch long trout they estimated weighed 37 pounds. The trout was promptly released. In 2009, Scott Sandusky, caught the Missouri state record Brown Trout which was 37 inches long and 24.75 inches in girth. It weighed 28.8 pounds and was taken on a spinning rod with 4 pound test line.
Recreation.
Lake Taneycomo is both a river and a lake. The shallow colder water, located near the Table Rock Dam, averages 48 degrees F. Here it resembles a river and allows fishing from the banks of the river. Moving downsteam the temperature of the water gets warmer and the lake deepens to more than 50 ft near the Powersite Dam in Forsyth. The current can be very strong when Table Rock dam is generating power. The water temperature also drops. At this time the fishing tends to be very good. All methods of trout fishing — fly fishing, fishing lures, and live bait fishing — may be used year-round to catch trout that inhabit the waters of Lake Taneycomo.
Lake Taneycomo offers a variety of recreational activities including hiking, sightseeing, hunting, fishing, boating, and waterskiing. People coming to Lake Taneycomo are able to visit area restaurants, shopping, and shows in the Branson area.

Multiple exposure

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
In photography, a multiple exposure is when a single frame of film is taken more than once. This usually happens accidentally if the photographer forgets to advance the film. To prevent multiple exposures, most modern cameras will not let the photographer open the shutter again until the film is advanced. It can also be used on purpose for special effects, such as creating a fake photograph of a ghost. The resulting image will be a combination of all of the shots. Multiple exposures are not possible on digital cameras, but the effect can be simulated with the alpha channel feature of photo editing software such as Photoshop or GIMP.

Louise Françoise de Bourbon

 Louise Françoise de Bourbon (1 June 1673 - 16 June 1743) was an illegitimate daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his famous mistress Madame de Montespan. Her marriage to a prince of the blood in 1685 caused great scandal and she had an open rivalry with her elder sister Françoise Marie, Duchess of Orléans. She was also responsible for the construction of the "Palais Bourbon" in Paris which is today used the French National government. She had a very close relationship with her older half-brother the "Grand Dauphin". Several of her children were thought to be illegitimate as, for a majority of her marriage she was having an affair with the Prince of Conti. Even when her husband succeeded to the Condé title the young princess was always known as Madame la Duchesse or the Duchess of Bourbon
Marriage.
On 25 May 1685, at the age of eleven, Louise Françoise was married to Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Bourbon, a distant sixteen-year old cousin of her father. Her husband was the son of Henry Jules, Duke of Enghien, the son of the head of the House of Condé, a cadet branch of the reigning House of Bourbon. His mother was Anne Henriette of Bavaria. Louis XIV gave his daughter a large dowry of one million livres upon her marriage. As she had married a prnce of the blood she thus outranked her sister who at the time was still unmarried. Louise Françoise and her husband eventually had nine children, all of whom survived into adulthood.

White River (Arkansas)

The White River is a 722-mile (1,162-km) long river that flows through the U.S. states of Arkansas and Missouri.
Course.
The source of the White River is in the Boston Mountains of northwest Arkansas, in the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest southeast of Fayetteville. The river flows northwards from its source in northwest Arkansas. It loops up through southwest Missouri into Table Rock Lake at Branson, Missouri. In Branson the river enters Lake Taneycomo, controlled by the Powersite Dam. The Powersite was the first dam on the White River. The flow continues downstream into Bull Shoals Lake. From there it travels back into Arkansas, and then heads generally southeast to where it flows into the Mississippi River. Despite being much shorter than the Arkansas River, it carries nearly as much water—normally more than 20,000 cuft/s, and occasionally more than 100,000 cuft/s during floods.
River modifications.
Lake Taneycomo was created in 1913 when the Empire District Electric Company built a dam just south of Forsyth, Missouri. Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake, and Bull Shoals Lake are man-made lakes or reservoirs created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This was under the authority of the Flood Control Act of 1938. A total of eight dams restrict the upper White River. Six are in Arkansas and two in Missouri. The White River National Wildlife Refuge lies along the lower part of the river. None of the original White River remains in Missouri. It has been replaced by a series of dams that flooded it's valleys. The White River was once known as one of the best Smallmouth bass fisheries in the world. Smallmouth still inhabit the impoundments but trout have replaced the smallmouth in much of the river, as the dams release much colder water.
Tributaries.
The tributaries of the White River include Cache River, Bayou des Arc, Little Red River, Black River, North Fork River, Buffalo River, Kings River, James River, and Roaring River. Some cities that lie on the White River are Newport, Augusta, Calico Rock, and Batesville, all in Arkansas, as well as Branson and Hollister in Missouri.
Angling.
Fishing for trout is popular in the upper portions of the river. This ranges from the Beaver Lake tailwaters in northwestern Arkansas, through its course through southwest Missouri(including all of Lake Taneycomo), and back down through Arkansas. This is to the Highway 58 bridge in Guion. The river has long been ranked one of the top trout fisheries in the United States. Fishing is popular in these waters for a number of trout species including rainbow, brown, and cutthroat trout. A number of trout fishing resorts lie on the tailwaters of Bull Shoals Lake and the North Fork River. Fishing for white bass is also popular in these waters.

Forsyth, Missouri

Forsyth is a city in Taney County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,255 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Taney County. It was incorporated as a village on 15 December 1890. Forsyth is located on what was the White River, now Lake Taneycomo.
History.
At the beginning of the American Civil War, Forsyth was occupied by Confederate forces. On 22 July 1861, Brigadier General Sweeney and 1,200 Union troops with artillery forced the Rebels out. Rebel forces withdrew from Forsyth but returned as soon as the Union troops left. In January 1863, the Union Army moved back into Forsyth, where they remained for several months. It took the ferry on the White River eight days to carry all the troops, supplies, horses and wagons across the river. Because of the Confederate threat, Union troops used logs from the town's houses to fortify their defenses. On 22 April 1863 Union forces left Forsyth, but set the town on fire to make sure that their fortifications did not fall into Rebel hands. When the fires died out all that remained of Forsyth was the burned-out shell of the big brick courthouse. The courthouse was eventually rebuilt. On 19 December 1885 the courthouse was totally destroyed along with all official records of the county and those of the only county newspaper. A new Taney County courthouse would not be constructed until 1890. On 15 December 1890 the village of Forsyth was incorporated. On 4 November 1891 the county court leased a room in the new courthouse to the first bank in Taney County, the new Taney County Bank, for the sum of $2.00 per month. 
In the late 1940s plans were being made in Washington, D.C. that would directly affect Forsyth. A dam (Bull Shoals) was to be built on the White River, approximately 80 miles below Forsyth. Two choices were left for the town; it could move to a new location or cease to exist. The city limits of Forsyth were extended 2 miles west of the old town site (now called Shadow Rock Park) to an area that had once been a golf course. In the early 1950s the town of Forsyth was moved to this location.

Smallmouth bass

The smallmouth bass ("Micropterus dolomieu") is a species of freshwater fish. They are in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of the order Perciformes. It is the type species of its genus. One of the black basses, it is a popular game fish sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America. they have been spread by stocking to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and the United States. The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, and up into the Hudson Bay basin. Its common names include smallmouth, bronzeback, brown bass, brownie, smallie, bronze bass, and bareback bass.
Description.
The smallmouth bass is generally brown (seldom yellow) with red eyes, and dark brown vertical bands. There are 13–15 soft rays in the dorsal fin. The upper jaw of smallmouth bass extends to the middle of the eye. Males are generally smaller than females. The males tend to weigh around two pounds. Females can range from three to six pounds. Their average sizes can differ, depending on where they are found. Those found in American waters tend to be larger due to the longer summers, which allow them to eat and grow for a longer period of time. Their habitat plays a significant role in their color, weight, and shape. Smallmouth that live dark water (such as rivers) tend to be rather torpedo-shaped and very dark brown. Smallmouth bass that live in sandy areas of lakes, tend to be a light yellow-brown and are more oval-shaped.
Habitat.
The smallmouth bass is found in clearer water than the largemouth, especially streams, rivers. They also prefer rocky areas, stumps, and also sandy bottoms of lakes and reservoirs. Smallmouth prefer cooler water temperatures than its cousin the Largemouth bass, and may be found in both still and moving water. Because it does not like pollution, the smallmouth bass is a good natural indicator of a healthy environment. Carnivorous, its diet comprises crayfish, insects, and smaller fish. Smallmouth fry feed on zooplankton and other aquatic life. But they will readily feed on their smaller siblings. 
The female lays from 1,000 to 6,000 eggs per pound of her body weight. The male creates a nest, usually in deeper water than the largemouth and larger than that of the largemouth. He then guards it chasing off the female so other females can lay their eggs in his nest. The fry hatch in a day or two, depending on water temperature. From that point they are on their own and leave the nest area quickly.
Angling.
In the United States, smallmouth bass were first introduced outside of their native range with the construction of the Erie Canal in 1825, extending the fish's range into central New York state. During the mid-to-late 19th century, smallmouth were transplanted via the nation's rail system to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far as California. Shippers found that smallmouth bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels by rail, sometimes using the spigots from the railroad water tanks to aerate the fingerlings. They were introduced east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards transplanted to the states of New England.
With increased industrialization and development, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were nasty, polluted, or allowed to silt up, raising water temperatures and killing off the native brook trout. Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers now too warm for native trout, and slowly became a popular game fish with many anglers. Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range. Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by pollution. They were also affected by the loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers to form lakes or reservoirs. In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations. and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.
Today, smallmouth bass are very popular game fish. They attract anglers using conventional as well as fly fishing tackle. The smallmouth bass is one of the toughest fighting freshwater fish in North America. In addition to wild populations, the smallmouth bass is stocked in cool rivers and lakes throughout Canada and the United States. In shallow streams, it is a wary fish, though usually not to the extent of most trout. The smallmouth is highly regarded for its topwater fighting ability when hooked. Old fishing journals referred to the smallmouth bass as "ounce for ounce and pound for pound the gamest fish that swims". Smallmouth bass are taken for the table, with filets of white, firm flesh when cooked. Today, many fishermen practice catch and release fishing to improve fish populations.
The current all-tackle world record for a smallmouth bass is 11 lb 15 oz, caught by David Hayes in the Dale Hollow Reservoir, on the Kentucky/Tennessee border, in 1955.
Tackle.
In conventional fishing, smallmouth may be successfully caught on a wide range of natural and artificial baits or lures. These include crankbaits, hair jigs, plastic jerkbaits, spinnerbaits, and all types of soft plastic lures, including curly tail grubs or tubes with lead head jigs. They may also be caught with a fly rod using a dry or wet artificial fly, nymphs, streamers, or imitations of larger aquatic creatures, such as hellgrammites, crawfish, or leeches. Floating topwater popper fly patterns and buzz baits are also popular for smallmouth fishing.
For river fishing, spinning tackle or fly tackle is usually the most popular angling tools for smallmouth in North America.

Miracle fruit

The miracle fruit is the berry of Synsepalum dulcificum, a plant from West Africa. The chemical produced by the fruit makes other food taste sweet. This chemical, called miraculin, is now being produced by transgenic tomato plants. Miraculin is a glycoprotein molecule, with some trailing carbohydrate chains.
The berry has a low sugar content and a mildly sweet taste. When the fruit is eaten, miraculin binds to the tongue's taste buds, causing sour foods to taste sweet. At neutral pH, miraculin binds and blocks the receptors, but at low pH (after eating sour food) miraculin binds protons and activates the sweet receptors. This is what causes the sweet taste. This effect lasts until the protein is washed away by saliva (up to about 60 minutes).

Thyroid-stimulating hormone

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (also known as thyrotropin, or TSH) is a hormone which stimulates the thyroid gland. 
The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which control how fast the body's chemical functions go (the metabolic rate). Thyroid hormones influence the metabolic rate in two ways: by stimulating almost every tissue in the body to produce proteins and by increasing the amount of oxygen that cells use. Thyroid hormones affect many vital body functions.
Thyrotropin is a glycoprotein hormone synthesized and secreted by thyrotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland, which adjusts the endocrine function of the thyroid gland.

A fish hatchery is where fish are hatched and cared for, usually to be released in natural waters (rivers, lakes, etc.). They may also be transferred to Fish farms and raised for food. Fish hatcheries and farms (also called aquaculture) are either commercial or run by a state, province, or country. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include Pacific oysters, shrimp, prawns, salmon, tilapia and scallops. In the United States in particular, many species of game fish are raised in hatcheries. These include black bass, trout, walleye, Northern pike, and Muskellunge.
The value of global aquaculture production is estimated to be US$98.4 billion in 2008 with China significantly dominating the market. However, the value of aquaculture hatchery and nursery production has yet to be estimated.

Histamine

Histamine is an organic nitrogenous compound involved in local immune responses. It also regulates physiological function in the gut, and acts as a neurotransmitter. Histamine is involved in the inflammatory response, where tissues get red, swollen and painful.
As part of an immune response to foreign pathogens, histamine is produced by basophils and by mast cells found in nearby connective tissues. Histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells and some proteins. The cells get through the walls of the tiny blood vessels to get at pathogens in the infected tissues.

Catch and release

Catch and release is a practice in sport fishing for conservation of the various species. Once caught, the fisherman carefully and quickly removes the hook from the fish's mouth. Then, without causing any harm, returns the fish alive to the water. Weighing and measuring of the fish, if done, are often done in the water. Using barbless hooks, it is often possible to release the fish without removing it from the water (a slack line is frequently sufficient).
Catch and release is an ethical decision by fishermen but it isn't for every situation. the Snakehead fish, for example, is an invasive species. It is illegal in many places to return them to the water. The Muskellunge is a highly prized game fish in many places. But, in a few places it is seen also as an invasive species and should not be returned to the water. 
Debates.
Debates continue over the practice of catch and release. In Canada, many First Nations peoples feel strongly that fish should only be taken as needed for food. That "playing with the fish" is not showing proper respect. Sportsmen point out that catch and release is respectful since they take only what they need and release the rest. 
Animal protection advocates have raised concerns about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling. A fish hooked in the gills or stomach usually has a very high Mortality rate. Hooks with no barbs or using hooks that dissolve in a short time (and are not removed from the fish) minimize harm to fish. But catch and release exposes a fish to being caught several times by multiple fishermen. Handling a fish several times may not be good resource management or humane. 
Even sportsmen have raised concerns over catch and release. The argument is that once caught, a fish is no longer wild. Who would want to catch the same trout others have caught? 
But the practice remains popular among many fishermen and among fish and game department biologists. Those in favor of catch and release quote Lee Wulff: "A trout is too valuable to be caught only once." Studies on the mortality of released fish shows a very low rate of from 2 to 5 percent—when caught on artificial lures. When using live bait, the mortality rate is about 50 percent. This indicates that using artificial bait is a strong part of catch and release.

Largemouth bass

The largemouth bass ("Micropterus salmoides") is a freshwater game fish in the sunfish family, a species of black bass native to North America. It is also known by a variety of regional names, such as the brown bass, widemouth bass, bigmouth bass, black bass, bucketmouth, Potter's fish, Florida bass, Florida largemouth, green bass, green trout, gilsdorf bass, linesides, Oswego bass, southern largemouth and northern largemouth. But, it is not a member of the bass family but actually a member of the Sunfish family. The largemouth bass is the state fish of Alabama (official freshwater fish), Georgia, Mississippi, Florida (state freshwater fish), and Tennessee (official sport fish).
Physical description.
The largemouth is an olive green fish, marked by a series of dark, sometimes black, forming a jagged horizontal stripe along each side. The upper jaw (maxilla) of a largemouth bass extends beyond the rear margin of the eye. In comparison to age, a female bass is larger than a male. The largemouth is the largest of the black basses. The largest reached a maximum recorded overall length of 29.5 in and a maximum unofficial weight of 25 lb. The fish lives 16 years on average.
Forage.
The juvenile largemouth bass eats mostly small bait fish, scuds, small shrimp, and insects. At about a year of age they become cannibalistic, eating other largemouths their size or smaller. As they mature they no longer consume their own kind. Adults consume smaller fish such as gizzard shad, fathead minnows and bluegills. These are swallowed head first. crustaceans such as crayfish are swallowed tail first. Largemouths can consume other fish up to 50% of their own length. sunfish and crustacean they eat tend to be no more than 35% of their own length. They will eat almost anything they can find in the water—snakes, mice, young waterfowl, birds and shrimp.
In larger lakes and reservoirs, adult bass occupy deeper water than younger fish. They shift to a diet consisting almost entirely of smaller fish like shad, yellow perch, ciscoes, shiners, and sunfish. Largemouth also consume younger members of larger fish species, such as pike, catfish, trout, walleye, white bass, and striped bass. The largemouth bass uses its senses of hearing, sight, vibration, and smell to attack and seize its prey. Adult largemouth are generally apex predators within their habitat, but they are preyed upon by many animals while young.
Angling.
Largemouth bass are widely sought after by anglers and are noted for the excitement of their fight. The fish will often jump out of the water in their effort to throw the Fishing hook. Anglers most often fish for largemouth bass with lures such as plastic worms (and other plastic baits), jigs, crankbaits and spinnerbaits. A recent trend is the use of large swimbaits to target trophy bass. Live bait, such as nightcrawlers, minnows, frogs, or crawfish can also be productive. Many bass anglers practice catch and release, especially the larger specimens. This is because larger specimens are usually breeding females that contribute heavily to future sport fishing stocks. Largemouth bass, if handled with care, respond well to catch and release.
The world all-tackle record largemouth bass was caught by George Perry in Montgomery Lake in Georgia in 1932. It weighed 22 pounds and 4 ounces. In 2009 a 22 pound, 4.97 ounce largemouth was caught in Japan by Manabu Kurita. By International Game Fish Association (IFGA) rules, a record fish of under 25 pounds must beat the previous record by 2 ounces or more to be a new record. The IFGA considers the two fish to share the current world record. However, the largemouth caught by George Perry in 1932 still holds the Georgia state record.

Megazostrodon

Megazostrodon is an early proto-mammal, discovered in Lesotho, southern Africa. 
It is one of the first mammals, and appeared in the fossil record about 200/205 million years ago (mya). It did have some non-mammalian characteristics, but overall this animal, and "Morganucodon", probably show the final stage of the transition between the cynodonts and true mammals.
Characteristics.
It is thought that the animal was nocturnal as it had a relatively much larger brain than its cynodont relatives, and the enlarged areas of its brain were found to be those which process sounds and smells. 
Nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heat.p124
From their size and teeth, "Megastrozodon" were probably insectivores, as were all its relatives at the time.p300 Their small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation, which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur. 
The night-time behaviour and insectivorous habits gave these early mammals a niche which did not compete with the reptiles. 
These early mammals developed many traits which made them well-suited for an active lifestyle. They developed four types of teeth. There is evidence that the inward-closing movement of the mandible suggests a shearing action to chew food. Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more flexible (they became less laterally splayed, allowing for faster forward motion) and they developed a shorter ribcage and larger lungs to allow for faster respiration. The structure of their jaw bones changed, the lower jaw becoming a single bone — the dentary. The other bones which once made up the jaw moved to the middle ear to create a hearing system.

Vector Laplacian

Pierre-Simon de Laplace used an operator in order to be able to model the movement of stars. This operator, later named Laplace operator, is used on functions of scalars. The Laplace operator, which is also called scalar Laplacian, applies to scalar fields and returns a scalar quantity. The Vector Laplacian applies to the vector fields and returns a vector quantity. When computed in rectangular Cartesian coordinates, the returned vector field is equal to the vector field of the scalar Laplacian applied on the individual elements. 
In physics, the Vector Laplacian is commonly used for the wave equations that are used to model electromagnetic fields.

Spotted bass

The spotted bass ("Micropterus punctulatus") also called the Kentucky Bass, is a freshwater game fish in the sunfish family. It is a species of black bass native to the lower and central Mississippi River basin in North America. It has been introduced into other U.S. states as far west as California. It has also been introduced into other countries. The spotted bass is often confused with the largemouth bass because it has the same coloring. But it is distinguished by having a smaller mouth than the largemouth. In size it is smaller than either the largemouth or smallmouth bass. In 1956 it became the official game fish of Kentucky. From that time on it was popularly called the Kentucky bass.
Subspecies.
Currently there are three recognized subspecies of spotted bass.
In addition there are reports of hybrid spotted bass occurring naturally. This is between largemouth and spotted bass—the offspring of which are difficult to identify as either species.
Physical description.
The spotted bass is a fish with a slender body marked by black on its side. As the fish matures these become an irregular band. Their color ranges from a light green to light brown. Unlike the largemouth, the tongue of the spotted bass has a patch of teeth. Their gill covers also have a large dark spot on them. The Alabama spotted bass is distinguished by a dark spot on the tail in addition to the one on each gill cover. The Northern spotted bass has a tail spot, but the gill spot is not as distinct. The average size is four to five pounds. The IFGA world record is 10 pounds 4 ounces. 
Habitat.
Unlike the largemouth bass, the spotted bass seems to like current (moving water). They can tolerate warmer water than largemouths and do well in streams and rivers. They can also thrive in southern reservoirs that have gravel and rock bottoms. Like it's better known cousins, the spotted bass is carnivorous. It will eat prey from the bottom to the surface of the water. If available it will feed primarily on crayfish. It also preys on minnows, catfish, and insects.
At spawning the male makes from one to four nests and defends them until the females lay their eggs. Females lay fewer eggs than largemouth or smallmouth bass. But once the eggs are deposited in the nest, she will remain to help guard the nest for another day before leaving. The male then guards the nest(s) against Bluegills and other raiding fish. They continue to guard the fry after hatching. Unlike other black basses, spotted bass tend to group together and form schools. They are sometimes seen chasing schools of shad in open water.
Angling.
Many spotted bass are caught by accident by fishermen seeking largemouth or smallmouth bass. They are found in streams and rivers like smallmouth, although they cannot tolerate water as cold. They also cannot tolerate the low oxygen saturation in warm water that largemouths can. Otherwise they live in the same waters. The spotted bass is a strong fighter, once hooked, much like the smallmouth. Unlike either of their cousins they do not tend to jump from the water. The same lures that attract other black bass also attract spotted bass. But their strong preference for crayfish makes any lure that resembles a crayfish very effective. In mid-summer, fishing in reservoirs, spotted bass can be as deep as 100 feet. Fishermen need to get their lures deep enough to attract the spotted bass.

The kodkod is the smallest cat in the Americas, found in Chile and Argentina. Its scientific name is "Leopardus guigna", and it is sometimes called the güiña. They are closely related to the other small cats of South America, such as the Ocelot and the Margay.
Kodkods live in mixed temperate rainforests of the southern Andes. They also live in the coastal forests of Chile, which have bamboo in the understory of the forest. They prefer evergreen temperate rainforests. They are tolerant of altered habitats, and are found in secondary forest and shrub as well as primary forest, and on the fringes of settled and cultivated areas.
Kodkods are active during the day and night, but they only go into open ground under the cover of darkness. During the day, they rest in dense vegetation in ravines, along streams with heavy cover. They are excellent climbers, and easily able to climb trees more than a meter in diameter. They are terrestrial predators of birds, lizards and rodents in the ravines and forested areas.
Male kodkods maintain exclusive territories 1.1 to in size, while females occupy smaller ranges of just 0.5 to.

Margay

The Margay ("Leopardus wiedii") is a spotted cat native to the Americas. It is a solitary and nocturnal animal which prefers remote parts of the rainforest. 
Life-style.
The margay is mostly nocturnal. It eats small mammals (sometimes including monkeys), birds, eggs, lizards and tree frogs. The margay is able to hunt its prey entirely in trees. However, they do sometimes hunt on the ground, and have been reported to eat cane rats and guinea pigs.
There is a report of a margay using sound mimicry to lure a prey. A margay was seen to imitate the call of an infant pied tamarin while in the presence of a group of adult tamarins. This caused the adults to investigate. Although the margay was not successful in catching a monkey, this was the first observation of a Neotropical predator using this type of mimicry.
Margays are mainly nocturnal, but they do sometimes hunt during the day. They prefer to spend most of their life in the trees, but also travel across the ground, especially when moving between hunting areas. During the day, they rest in safe branches or clumps of lianas.
Like most cats, they are solitary: the adults usually meet only to mate. They have large home ranges of 11 to. They use scent to mark their territory (urine spraying) and leave scratch marks on the ground or on branches. Their vocalisations are short range: they do not call to each other over long distances.
Special adaptations.
The margay is one of only two cat species with ankles flexible enough to climb head-first down trees. The other is the clouded leopard; the little-studied marbled cat may also have this ability. 
The margay is very agile; its ankles can turn up to 180 degrees, it can grasp branches equally well with its fore and hind paws, and it is able to jump up to 12 ft horizontally. The margay has been seen to hang from branches with only one foot, and can run upside down beneath branches.
Conservation.
Although once thought to be vulnerable to extinction, the IUCN now lists it as only "near threatened". It roams the rainforests from Mexico to Argentina. Actually, it is a successful and widespread species. It has ten subspecies over a large geographical range from Mexico to Argentina. Its past range even included the southern United States.
They are hunted mainly for their fur and this has resulted in a large population decrease - around 14,000 are killed a year. They also suffer from a loss of habitat, which is also a significant part of this decline.

Oasis, Missouri

Coordinates: 
Oasis was a village in Taney County, Missouri, in the Ozark Mountains. Originally it was named Cedar Valley. Oasis currently rests under 100 feet of water near the bottom of Table Rock Lake. The underwater village is a popular technical dive for scuba divers.
History.
Oasis was a small outpost located on Long Creek south of Branson, Missouri. It had dirt roads and fewer than 10 buildings in the whole village. Oasis also had a three story mill with a mill dam, and a general store. The store was also the local polling place for the surrounding community. 
The village was originally named Cedar Valley. Is not certain when the name was changed to Oasis. But the the name Oasis reflected the picturesque ("pretty as a picture") scene of a small farming community. In 1935 Oasis had all of 21 residents. From the big red mill there were roads going south into Arkansas. Other roads went north into other parts of Missouri. Originally Long creek had two fords nearby. Taney county built a bridge near the mill at a cost of several thousand dollars. But the bridge didn't go anywhere. One end had no access road. The other end was built up against a steep hill. There were no funds to build a road to the bridge. Nor were there funds to blast out a road from the rock on the other side. So it remained unused for 10 years. Finally the roads were finally built. The one-lane bridge was connected to Highway 86.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the idea came up to dam the White River (Arkansas). This was to generate hydroelectric power. The reservoir created by the dam would serve also for flood control on the White River. The dam was authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1941. But World War II and the Korean War delayed construction until 1954. Construction on the Table Rock dam was completed in 1958. It created an impoundment that flooded nearly 79 miles of the White River. It created a lake of over 50,000 acres. Oasis now sits under 100 feet (30m) of water. The church, mill, and other buildings were covered by the lake. The church cemetery was moved to the new Cedar Valley Church on U.S. Route 65.
Diving Table Rock.
Advanced divers can dive down to Oasis and swim up and down the main street. Parts of the old wood church are still there as are foundations of several buildings. While Table Rock is deep, it is not murky like typical lakes. Underwater visibility is good, making scuba diving a popular sport in the lake.
Table Rock State Park has a Dive shop at the marina. Table Rock is also used for dive training by over 15 area dive shops. Other attractions in the lake include the 'Enchanted Forest', a forest of submerged oak trees full of very large bass. There are shipwrecks that are frequently dived on. One is the the 'Zebulon Pike', a twin-deck riverboat. Not far from the dock of the Branson Belle, lies a 40-foot (12 m) cruiser. There are numerous smaller wrecks throughout the lake. Classes for search and recovery divers are also held here.

General store

A general store, (also called a 'general merchandise store', 'general dealer' or 'village shop') is a rural or small town store that carries a very general selection of merchandise. The store is often a small space. It is where people from the town and surrounding rural areas come to purchase staple food items such as milk and bread. Also the various other goods, dry goods and hardware homes and farms might need. It sometimes served as a village or town meeting place where neighbors exchanged news and gossip. The concept of the general store is very old, and although some still exist, there are far fewer than there once were, due to urbanization, urban sprawl, and the relatively recent phenomenon of big-box stores.

Leopard cat

The leopard cat ("Prionailurus bengalensis") is a small wild cat of South and East Asia. Since 2002 it has been listed as least concern by IUCN. It is widely distributed, but habitat loss and hunting occurs in places. There are twelve leopard cat subspecies, which differ widely in appearance.
The small cat is not closely related to the leopard. Its leopard-like spots gave it the name.
Distribution.
Leopard cats are the most widely distributed Asian small cats. Their range extends from the Russian Far East, Korea, China, Indochina, the Indian subcontinent, northern Pakistan, the Philippines and the Sunda islands of Indonesia. 
They prefer forested habitats, but are found in agriculturally used areas. They live in tropical evergreen rainforests and plantations at sea level, and in subtropical deciduous and conifer forests in the foothills of the Himalayas above 1000 m.
The highest altitudinal record was at 4500 m in the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area.
In the northeast of their range they live close to rivers, valleys and in ravine forests, but avoid areas with more than 10 cm of snowfall. They are rare in Pakistan’s dry treeless areas. In Afghanistan, they were reported in the 1970s from Jalalkot and Norgul in the Kunar Valley, and the Waygul forest of Dare Pech.

Montgomery Bus Boycott

The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a major event in the Civil rights movement. It occurred in Montgomery, Alabama where the city buses were segregated. Black passengers were required by law to ride in the back of the bus. On December 1, 1955 Rosa Parks, an African American woman, refused to give her bus seat to a white person. She was arrested and sent to jail. In protest 50,000 black people boycotted the Montgomery city buses, refusing to ride. The boycott lasted 381 days. On November 13, 1956, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision to desegregate the buses. In response the city of Montgomery passed a law allowing black passengers to sit anywhere on the buses. The boycott ended on December 20, 1956. Many important people in the civil rights movement took part in the boycott. This included Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Abernathy.

Turbidity

Turbidity is a measure of how well light penetrates water. It is caused by particles (total suspended or dissolved solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality.
Fluids can contain suspended particles of many different sizes. Some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom if a liquid sample is left to stand. Very small particles settle very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid or murky.
Causes.
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of phytoplankton. Naturally occurring Algal blooms can cause turbidity. Human activities that disturb land can lead to high sediment levels entering water bodies during rain storms due runoff. These can include construction, mining and agriculture. pollution from paved surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots is another source. Certain industries such as quarrying, mining and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from rock particles entering the water.
In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop diseases. Contaminants like viruses or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from ultraviolet (UV) sterilization of water.
In water bodies such as lakes, rivers and reservoirs, high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths. This can limit growth of submerged aquatic plants. In turn this affects species which are dependent on them, such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This situation has been regularly observed throughout the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.

IOS 6

iOS 6 is the sixth major version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. It was released on September 19, 2012, and the latest version is iOS 6.1.6.
Until now, it is still running on about 11% of devices (the percentage including devices that are not supported) besides iOS 7's 87% (including non-supported devices) and the last 2% (including non-supported devices) are for older iOS versions.
History.
iOS 6 was shown during Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2012 on June 11, 2012. This software dropped support for older devices such as the third generation iPod Touch and the first generation iPad following the cycle of past iOS versions. It is supported on the iPhone 3GS and later, the fourth generation iPod Touch and later, the iPad 2 and later, and the iPad Mini.
On September 12, 2012, at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the iPhone 5, the fifth generation iPod Touch, and the final release of iOS 6.0 were revealed at the event. It was announced that iOS 6 would be released on September 19, 2012.
The iPhone 5 had iOS 6 already installed, but other devices will need to get it installed as an over-the-air update or through iTunes. An iTunes update, version 10.7, was released on September 12, 2012, and it was needed in order to install iOS 6 on a device.
Features.
Unlike past iOS versions, two apps that were removed as part of iOS 6 were Google Maps and YouTube. These apps can be downloaded for free in the App Store.
The all-new Maps application uses a different engine that helps to get rid of lag and make for smoother zooming. It also adds turn-by-turn directions and 3D views in some cites.
Problems.
In iOS 6, the Google Maps application was replaced with Apple's own maps. It caused many poor reviews, with information that is not complete, maps that are not correct, no support for transit maps, and low-quality satellite images.
The iOS 6.1 update released on January 28, 2013 had reports of reduced battery life and issues with signal strength.

Simple harmonic motion

 In mathematics and physics, when something moves so that its distance from a fixed point (plotted on a graph against time) looks like a sine wave, the movement is called simple harmonic motion. This sort of movement will happen whenever the force towards the fixed point is proportional to the distance from the point and always acts towards that point. Examples include a weight on a spring and a pendulum (approximately). 
The amplitude is the biggest distance from the fixed point. The period is the time taken to get back to the same point again (with the same speed and in the same direction).
The equations of simple harmonic motion can be found by looking at a fixed wheel with radius formula_1 that is spinning with steady speed formula_2 radians per second. The time formula_3 taken for one complete turn is formula_4 formula_5 because there are formula_6 radians in a full circle.
Imagine a white spot painted on the rim of the wheel. If it starts level with the axle, and the wheel has turned through an angle formula_7 in time formula_8 seconds, then the height formula_9 of the spot above the axle is given by formula_10 (where formula_11 means the sine of the angle turned, and trigonometry is used to find the height).

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Mr. Popper's Penguins is a 2011 American comedy family movie. It was directed by Mark Waters, and stars Jim Carrey. It was loosely based on the children's book of the same name. The movie was released on June 17, 2011.
Plot.
Thomas "Tom" Popper has a job buying and selling properties. He gets news that his father has died during an adventure to Antarctica. Popper's lawyer tells him he will inherit a souvenir from his father's last adventure. 
A crate arrives at Popper's front door, with a gentoo penguin (Captain) inside. Soon, because of confusion with a crew member, five more penguins arrive: (Bitey, Stinky, Lovey, Nimrod, and Loudy). Popper wants to donate all six penguins to a pest control company. But his children, Janie Popper and Billy Popper, think that the penguins are Billy's birthday present. Mr. Popper meets with a zookeeper, Nat Jones, who also wants the penguins. Popper asks him to collect the penguins another time. Jones agrees, but he warns that the conditions in Popper's apartment are not good enough to raise penguins.
At the same time, Popper is given the task of buying "Tavern on the Green", where he used to eat with his father as a child. He wants to tear it down and building a new development in its place. However, its elderly owner, Selma Van Gundy, refuses to sell it to him. She does not like his plan.
The penguins soon lay three eggs. Two of the eggs hatch and one doesn’t. Popper loses his job while waiting for the last egg to hatch. He has made his bosses angry for not focusing on the tavern for them. Jones sneaks in the apartment one night and warns him that penguins can only survive in the cold or zoo and vows to get the penguins sometime. Popper puts snow in his apartment, and lowers his temperature for the penguins in an attempt to help. Finally, realizing that the egg can’t be hatched, Popper sadly donates all the pigeons to Jones for the New York zoo. He then is re-hired by his bosses, and refocuses his attention on purchasing the Tavern on the Green. His family is not happy. The next day his ex-wife decides to travel to Africa for three weeks with her boyfriend Rick, and leaves the kids in his care. 
Popper finds a lost letter from his father, which had been sent with the first penguin, Captain. In it, his father tells him to love his children, just as this penguin would love him. Having a change of heart, Popper asks his children and ex-wife to help him get the penguins back from the zoo before his ex-wife goes to Africa and he sells the tavern.
Popper and his family ask Jones about getting the penguins back, but Jones refuses. He lies and says they have been traded to other zoos. But Popper discovers that Jones is lying with help from the shouting penguin named Loudy. He frees the penguins from a cooler in the office and locks Jones inside. While escaping, Popper and his family notice that Jones has managed to get free and security guards are looking everywhere for them. Popper and his family manage to escape with the penguins and flee to the tavern with Jones in pursuit on a golf-cart. 
After seeing how Popper had reunited his family and rescued the penguins, Van Gundy sells him the restaurant. But rather than tear it and the park down, Popper orders that the restaurant be renovated and reopened. Immediately after Van Gundy makes the deal with Popper, Jones arrives with the police to arrest Popper for theft of the penguins. After explaining the story in front of the crowd and police, the officers agree to spare Popper from prison if they can find out who the penguins love. Jones holds up a sardine for the penguins, thinking they love fish more than Popper, but the penguins go to Popper instead. The crowd applauds for Popper. Jones gets hysterical and angry, so police officers arrest Jones instead. 
Popper and his family travel to Antarctica with the penguins, allowing them to live with their own kind and promising to visit on occasions. Popper's first penguin, Captain, is revealed to have laid another egg. Popper tells his children that they'll have to come back and visit when the baby, who he named Bald Eagle, is born.
Production.
Originally, Ben Stiller was supposed to play Mr. Popper, and Noah Baumbach was originally going to direct, but they dropped out. Owen Wilson, Jack Black, and Jim Carrey were all considered to replace Stiller, with the role eventually going to Carrey. Mark Waters was chosen to direct. 
On September 21, 2010, it was confirmed that Carla Gugino joined the cast as Tom's ex-wife Amanda Popper.
The musical score was ambitious, with music playing nearly throughout. It was written by Rolfe Kent, and orchestrated by Tony Blondal. It was recorded at the scoring stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City, Ca. with a 78 piece orchestra.
An online Museum Slide Game created by designer Mark Kavanaugh as promotional material for the film is still accessible.
Box office and critical reception.
The film earned $6.4 million on opening day and $18.4 million over the three-day weekend, ranking in third place behind "Green Lantern" and "Super 8". The opening was at the high end of 20th Century Fox's expectations, which was predicting a mid to high teens opening. In its second weekend, the film faced competition from "Cars 2" and dropped 45% to $10.1 million and ranked in fifth place. Over the four-day Independence Day holiday weekend, it ranked in eighth place after dropping 34% to $6.7 million. The film has earned $68,224,452 domestically and $119,137,302 in foreign countries, grossing a total of $187,361,754 worldwide.
The film has received mixed reviews from critics, with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 48%, based on 136 reviews, as of August 2012. The consensus reads "Blandly inoffensive and thoroughly predictable, Mr. Popper's Penguins could have been worse—but it should have been better." It was released in Blu-ray and DVD on December 6, 2011 along with "The Help", "The Debt", "Cowboys & Aliens", and "The Hangover Part II".

Bergmann's rule

Bergmann's rule is an ecogeographic principle. It states that, within a widely distributed group of animals, the larger ones are found in colder environments, and the smaller ones are found in warmer regions. 
So, for example, with bears the largest member is the polar bear, and the smallest members are found in subtropical areas (panda). The largest tiger is the Siberian tiger. Large mammals of the late ice age were in general larger than their descendants today.
The rule is named after nineteenth-century German biologist Carl Bergmann, who described the pattern in 1847, though he was not the first to notice it. Bergmann's rule appears to hold true for many mammals and birds, but there are exceptions. 
Although originally put in terms of species, it seems to apply to populations within a species. Bergmann's rule is most often applied to mammals and birds which are endotherms, but some researchers have also found evidence for the rule in studies of ectothermic species. 
In addition to being a general pattern across space, Bergmann’s rule has been reported in extinct populations from the fossil record. In particular, reversible dwarfing of mammals happened during two extremely warm but rather brief times in the Palaeogene.

Fishing cat

The fishing cat ("Prionailurus viverrinus") is a medium-sized wild cat of South and Southeast Asia. Fishing cats are the largest of the "Prionailurus" cats. They are about twice the size of a domestic cat and have a stocky, muscular build with medium to short legs. 
In 2008, the IUCN classified the fishing cat as "Endangered". They live in wetland habitats, which are increasingly being settled, degraded and converted. Over the last decade, the fishing cat population throughout much of its Asian range declined severely.
Like its closest relative, the leopard cat, the fishing cat lives along rivers, streams and mangrove swamps. It is well adapted to this habitat, being an eager and skilled swimmer. Its feet are partly webbed, and it does catch fish.

Cove

A cove is a small type of bay or coastal inlet. Coves usually have narrow, restricted entrances. They are often circular or oval, and are often found in a larger bay. Small, narrow, sheltered bays, inlets, creeks, or recesses in a coast are often considered coves. The term can also be used to describe a valley between two mountain ridges. Coves are formed by differential erosion. Differential erosion occurs when softer rocks are worn away faster than the harder rocks around them. These rocks further erode to form a circular bay with a narrow entrance called a cove.

Laplace operator

In mathematics the Laplace operator or Laplacian is a differential operator given by the divergence of the gradient of a function on Euclidean space. It is usually denoted by the symbols ∇·∇, ∇2 or ∆. The Laplacian ∆"f"("p") of a function "f" at a point "p", up to a constant depending on the dimension, is the rate at which the average value of "f" over spheres centered at "p", deviates from "f"("p") as the radius of the sphere grows. In a Cartesian coordinate system, the Laplacian is given by the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable. In other coordinate systems such as cylindrical and spherical coordinates, the Laplacian also has a useful form.
The Laplace operator is named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749–1827), who first applied the operator to the study of celestial mechanics. In this case, the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when it is applied to a given gravitational potential. Solutions of the equation ∆"f" = 0, now called Laplace's equation, are the so-called harmonic functions, and represent the possible gravitational fields in free space.
The Laplacian occurs in differential equations that describe many physical phenomena, such as electric and gravitational potentials, the diffusion equation for heat and fluid flow, wave propagation, and quantum mechanics. The Laplacian represents the flux density of the gradient flow of a function. For instance, the net rate at which a chemical dissolved in a fluid moves toward or away from some point is proportional to the Laplacian of the chemical concentration at that point; the resulting equation is the diffusion equation. For these reasons, the Laplace operator is used in the sciences for modelling all kinds of physical phenomena. In image processing and computer vision, the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and edge detection.

Bull Shoals Lake

Bull Shoals Lake is an artificial lake or reservoir. It is in the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri. Bull Shoals has hundreds of miles of lake arms and coves. This makes it good for boating, water sports, swimming, and fishing. Nineteen developed parks around the shoreline. These provide campgrounds, boat launches, swim areas, and marinas.
History.
Bull Shoals Dam was created to impound (hold water in a reservoir) the White River. Bull Shoals has one of the largest concrete dams in the United States. It was the 5th largest dam in the world when the project was started. Work on the dam began in 1947 and was completed in 1951. In 1952 it was dedicated by President Harry S. Truman At least seven small family cemeteries and 20 larger cemeteries were carefully moved to make room for the new lake.
Hydrology.
Bull Shoals Lake is the last reservoir on the White River before it enters the Mississippi River. The other three are Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake and Lake Taneycomo. Bull Shoals lake is controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers and has the primary purpose of flood control. The level of the lake changes regularly. The normal pool level elevation is 654 feet above sea level, which is locally known as 'powerpool'. However, the elevation changes between 630 to 680 feet.
The upper part of the lake, below nearby Powersite Dam, is known as the "Pothole". The dam is designed for a maximum elevation of 695 feet (top of the flood pool). Bull Shoals Lake covers 45,000 acres (182 km²) with a 700-mile (1,120-km) shoreline at powerpool. It expands to more than 70,000 acres (284 km²)with a 1,000-mile (1,600-km) shoreline at 690 feet. The bottom of the lake consists of bedrock with very little vegetation. The shoreline of the lake is protected by a buffer zone (locally called the 'take line'). This area is owned, managed, and controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. There is very little development around Bull Shoals. Most of the shoreline is heavily forested.
State park.
The Bull Shoals-White River State Park is a 725 acre (2.9 km²) park in Baxter and Marion Counties of Arkansas. It lies both above and below the large dam. Facilities, including camping, pavilions, docks and a nature center, stretch along the banks of the White River. The park offers 103 riverside campsites and 20 tent sites. Two rent-a-camp and two rent-a-RV sites are also available. Picnic areas and pavilions are scattered throughout the park. There are trails through the surrounding woods. A marina contains boating equipment and also rents boats. The visitors' center offers programs, workshops, camps, boating and fishing exhibits and an aquarium. Tours of the power generation plant and other dam facilities are available for a fee.
Fishing.
Table Rock is one of the premier Largemouth bass fishing lakes in the United States. The best time for bass fishing is between March and May. This is when the bass spawn in the shallows. Bull Shoals Lake is Arkansas's largest lake, and is also well known as a trout hot spot. Rainbow trout and brown trout of record size have been caught in the lake, with bream, catfish, crappie and largemouth bass also plentiful. Swimming and other watersports are also welcome at the lake. Arkansas Highway 178 runs along the top of Bull Shoals Dam and into the park.
Flooding of 2008.
Record rainfall in the spring of 2008 caused Bull Shoals to reach its highest water level since 1957. The lake crested at 695.02 feet above sea level. The Army Corps of Engineers opened the floodgates to stop the lake from more flooding.

 A pulse traveling through a string with fixed endpoints as modeled by the wave equation.
Spherical waves coming from a point source.
Equations that describe waves as they occur in nature are called wave equations. Waves as they occur in rivers, lakes, and oceans are similar to those of sound and light. The problem of having to describe waves arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics.
Historically, the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange. In 1746, d’Alambert discovered the one-dimensional wave equation, and within ten years Euler discovered the three-dimensional wave equation.

Dementia praecox is a term which Bénédict Augustin Morel first used in 1860, to describe the condition of a teenager who retreated from society, and started to show symptoms similar to those of dementia. Dementia is a mental illness which mostly occurs in old people. 
Emil Kraepelin used the term to describe, and contrasted it with the mental illness called Bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder often have episodes in which they seem normal, which people with "dementia praecox" do not.
This theory could not be proved. In 1911, Eugen Bleuler said that "dementia praecox" was actually schizophrenia.

Champagne Supernova

"Champagne Supernova" is the sixth and final single off English rock band Oasis' second studio album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?". The song was released on 13 May 1996.
In an interview, lead guitarist Noel Gallagher said of the song:
"Some of the lyrics were written when I was out of it. There's the words: 'Someday you will find me/ Caught beneath a landslide/ In a Champagne Supernova in the sky'. That's probably as psychedelic as I'll ever get. It means different things when I'm in different moods. When I'm in a bad mood being caught beneath a landslide is like being suffocated. The song is a bit of an epic. It's about when you're young and you see people in groups and you think about what they did for you and they did nothing. As a kid, you always believed the Sex Pistols were going to conquer the world and kill everybody in the process. Bands like The Clash just petered out. Punk rock was supposed to be the revolution but what did it do? Fuck all. The Manchester thing was going to be the greatest movement on earth but it was fuck all. When we started we decided we weren't going to do anything for anybody, we just thought we'd leave a bunch of great songs. But some of the words are about nothing. One is about Bracket The Butler who used to be on Camberwick Green, or Chipley or Trumpton or something. He used to take about 20 minutes to go down the hall. And then I couldn't think of anything that rhymed with 'hall' apart from 'cannonball'. so I wrote 'Slowly walking down the hall/ Faster than a cannonball' and people were like, 'Wow, fuck , man'. There's also the line 'Where were you while we were getting high?' because that's what we always say to each other. But the number of people who've started clubs called Champagne Supernova is fucking unbelievable. And the album isn't even released yet."

Infante Philip, Duke of Calabria

Prince Philip of Naples and Sicily, Duke of Calabria, Infante of Spain (13 June 1747 – 19 September 1777). At his birth he was the eldest son of King Carlo of Naples and Sicily and was the heir to the throne but never succeeded. His younger brothers, Charles IV of Spain and Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies replaced him in the succession. When his father became King of Spain in 1759, Philip remained in Naples where he lived until his death from smallpox at the age of thirty. He was given the title of Duke of Calabria as heir to the throne.
Life.

Arctic char

Arctic char or Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, is a cold water fish in the family Salmonidae. It is native to Arctic, sub-Arctic and alpine lakes. It breeds in fresh water. Char may either be landlocked or anadromous, migrating to the sea. No other freshwater fish is found as far north. It the only fish species in Lake Hazen on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. It is one of the rarest fish species in Britain.found only in deep, cold, glacial lakes, and is at risk from acidification. In other parts of its range, such as Scandinavia, it is much more common, and is fished extensively. It is also common in the Alps, (particularly in Trentino and in the mountain part of Lombardy). Char are also found in Iceland. In Siberia, it is known as "golets". The Arctic char is a relative of both salmon and lake trout. It shares traits with both. The char's color depends on the time of year and where it lives. The back is usually dark brown or olive green. On its sides it has dark spots on a light background. The color can be gold, brown, red, or orange. At spawning the fins and belly become bright red or orange.

Dolly Varden

The Dolly Varden ("Salvelinus malma") is a species of salmonid. It is native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. In the past it has been mistaken for a species of trout. Dolly Varden are in the genus "Salvelinus" of true chars. They are covered with light spots on a dark background (trout have dark spots on a light background). They may either be landlocked or anadromous (meaning they migrate to the sea). The coloring depends on their environment. Those that travel to the sea (anadromous) are dark blue on the head, back and upper sides. Freshwater (or landlocked) Dolly Varden are brown to olive green on the head, back and upper sides. The belly is light colored. They feed on aquatic insects, other fish and their eggs.
Origin of the name.
Dolly Varden was the name of a fictional character in an 1841 Charles Dickens novel. She was known for liking brightly colored dresses. At that time very colorful women's dresses were called "Dolly Vardens". Livingston Stone noted that in 1872 fishermen on the McCloud River in California were calling the brightly colored fish they caught "Dolly Varden" after the dresses. But there were no Dolly Varden in the McCloud river. They may have been catching its near relative the Bull Trout. In spite of the mistake the name stuck for 'Salvelinus malma'.

Lake trout

 
Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is not a trout but a member of the freshwater char family. It lives mainly in lakes in northern North America. It is dark gray to olive green in color. It has light spots on their sides. Lake trout have a deeply forked tail. It is a species that has adapted well to the arctic and boreal regions of North America. It will eat nearly anything but can go long periods without food. It can eat other fish that are half it's own length.Lake trout can live from 25 to 40 years. Lake trout spawn eight to ten years in a row. The female produces 1,000 eggs for every kilogram she weighs. The largest Lake trout ever caught was in Canada and weighed 121 pounds. Other names for it include mackinaw, lake char (or charr), touladi, togue, and grey trout. In Lake Superior, it can also be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish.

Porcupine caribou

The porcupine caribou or Grant's caribou ("Rangifer tarandus granti") is a subspecies of the caribou. They are found in Alaska and parts of Canada. It resembles the subspecies, barren-ground caribou ("R. t. groenlandicus"), and is sometimes included in it.
Migratory caribou herds are named after their birthing grounds. In this case it is the Porcupine River, which runs through a large part of the range of the Porcupine herd. The herd has been losing numbers in recent years. In 1989 they numbered about 178,000. The estimates for 2010 numbered them at about 169,000. They migrate over 1500 mi a year between their winter range and calving grounds on the Beaufort Sea. It is the longest land migration route of any land mammal on earth. Their range spans across the Alaska/Yukon border. They are jointly managed by Alaska, Canada and local Native American peoples. They are important food for the Gwichʼin. They are a First Nations/Alaska Native people, who traditionally follow the caribou. The herd is also routinely hunted by other peoples, including the Inupiat, Inuvialuit, Hän, and Northern Tutchone.

Boston Mountains

The Boston Mountains area is a high and deeply dissected plateau. They are located in northern Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. The Oklahoma portion of the range is locally called the Cookson Hills. The rocks of the region are sedimentary layers of the Paleozoic age. The highest ridges and peaks are capped by Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale. The deeply eroded valleys are cut into Mississippian limestones and below that layer Ordovician dolomites.
The Boston Mountains form the southwestern part of the Ozark plateau. They are the highest and most rugged part of the Ozarks. This is because of their young age relative to the other sections. The highest point is 2,578 feet. It has valleys 500 to 1,550 feet deep. Turner Ward Knob (TWK) is the highest named peak. It is in western Newton County, Arkansas and rises to 2463 ft.
The Boston Mountains are the source of several rivers and streams. They flow out from the mountains in all directions. The Boston mountains are the sources of the White River, the Buffalo River, the Kings River and War Eagle Creek. Other rivers and streams having their headwaters in the Boston Mountains include the Illinois River, the Mulberry River, Lee Creek, Frog Bayou, Big Piney Creek, Illinois Bayou, and the Little Red River. To the south, the Arkansas River valley separates the Boston Mountains from the Ouachita Mountains.

Gryphaea

Gryphaea (the Devil's toenail) is a genus of extinct oysters which were once very common. Their fossils are common on the Jurassic Coast in southern England, and in the margins of the old Sundance Sea in the United States. It is a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Gryphaeidae. 
These bivalves were at their peak in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, when they sat in huge muddy oyster beds in shallow tropical seas. The genus survived a long time, but went extinct about 34 million years ago (mya). 
The oyster shell has two 'valves': a larger gnarly-shaped shell (the 'toenail') and a smaller, flattened shell, the 'lid'. The soft parts of the animal lived in the gap between the two shells, just like modern oysters. The shells have prominent growth bands. The large curved shell sat in the mud on the sea floor. 
Where to find it.
In England at the coasts of Redcar and Weymouth in the Kimmeridgian clay; in the U.S.A in riverbanks and cliffs of Texas and Kansas. They are often washed out of the clay onto the beach or river banksides.

he Ozark – St. Francis National Forest is a U.S. National Forest that is located in the state of Arkansas. It is made up of two separate forests, the Ozark National Forest and the St. Francis National Forest. Each has their own biological, topographical, and geological differences. Together, the two forests are home to 25 developed campgrounds. They also include swimming areas, hiking trails, and streams for fishing. The majority of the trails in both were constructed under the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps.
The Forest contains 11000 acre of old-growth forests. These typically occur in the southern portion of the Forest on ridges and steep south-facing slopes. They are dominated by Shortleaf Pine and various oaks. The oaks include Post Oak, Blackjack Oak, Eastern Black Oak, White Oak, and Northern Red Oak. The Forest is also home to five different endangered species of wildlife. It also has an additional three threatened species.

Old-growth forest

An old-growth forest (also called primary forest, virgin forest, primeval forest, late seral forest, or in Britain, ancient woodland) is a forest that has reached a great age without much disturbance.
It has unique ecological features, and might be classified as a climax community. Old-growth features include various tree-related structures. These provide wildlife habitats which increase the bio-diversity of the forested ecosystem.
Usually old-growth forests have multi-layered open canopies. They also include varied tree heights and diameters with fallen logs on the forest floor. In Europe less than 7% of forests are old-growth, mainly due to industrial logging in the 20th century. In the United States estimates are that only 10% of old-growth forests remain. In Asia old-growth forests are sometimes lost in regional conflicts.

Joan Castejón

Joan Ramón García Castejón, Elche, (December 17, 1945), known as Joan Castejón is a Spanish draftsman, painter and sculptor, considered one of the leading representatives of social realism in the Spanish postwar plastic renewal of the 70s and 80s. Member of the Grup d'Elx.
His work has been exhibited in some of the most important museums in Spain, among others, the Institut Valencià d'Art Modern (IVAM), the Museum of the University of Alicante, Guerricabeitia Martinez Collection at the University of Valencia, Miguel Hernández University of Elche, the Bancaja Foundation Center, Centre of the Carmen Valencia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Elche.
Biography.
Early life.
At sixteen he moved to Valencia, where he received training in the fine arts at the Academy of San Carlos. His first solo exhibition is held in the Valencian art gallery Mateu in 1966. This first moment of his career (1964-1967) can be described as neofigurative. The human figure (sometimes grouped) appears in the middle of undefined spaces. Works from this stage, including anthropomorphic themed drawings, announce the peculiar features that characterize his later works.
Political imprisonment.
That momentum of his career was cut short, however, by the traumatic time in prison tafter taking part in the demonstrations of May 1967 in Valencia against Francoist regimen. After standing up for a friend who was being brutally beat, a plainclothes agent arrested Castejón. He received several beatings that night and short after that was sentenced to six years in prison. Until mid 1969 remains in prisons of Valencia and Teruel. That year became part of the Grup d'Elx in its second stage, participating in their exhibitions until 1971. On these facts, re-enters the prison in the Canary Islands during seven months of 1971. While in prison he draw around two thousand drawings with wax or pencil, and define another specific stage of production.
Dénia.
Castejón marries Paca Galván and in 1973 returned to Valencia where he briefly rejoins the local art scene, but a year later he settled permanently in Dénia. Takes up painting. Explicit and shocking expressionism during this decade of the seventies. Later in the 80s explores a brighter abstraction inspired by the landscape. Theatrical virtuoso drawing dominates the 90s. Human being has become the central poetics reference of his work. 
In 1999 he was appointed Adopted Son of Dénia, the city where he lives since 1974.
Works.
If there is one aspect that stands out in the work of Joan Castejón is his exceptional drawing skills, a palpable mastery also in his painting and leading to write to José Manuel Caballero Bonald "the artist draws a classic and meditate as a prophet". The author and official historian of Alicante Enrique Cerdan Tato wrote in El Pais on the work of Castejón: " ... he wanted to express the universe of man revealed by violence".
On leaving prison he painted a series of one hundred works inspired by the work of Gabriel García Márquez One Hundred Years of Solitude, which exposes in Valencia and Barcelona. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote on this occasion about Castejón's art: "So one of the most interesting aspects of this collection of pictures of Castejón show that even today the art of painting can, without abandon modernity, have the literature as a starting point. Like a woman, a dream, or a crime, a novel can be for an artist a creative ferment... " 
Artur Balder writes, in relation to the work of Castejón, that "an indispensable condition of the Gesamtkunstwerk, with a base of either visual, literary, or musical representation, is its timeless condition, its ability to withstand the test of time itself by rising instead of sinking into the spasm of momentary fashion, and perish with it a few years, and only to be seen in that context, as in a narrow place of history. However, Castejón, next to the absolute hero in its representation of humanism, can be attributed, as an artist, as Juan Gil-Albert described, "in whose light the depths of so looming giant men, that I was forced to retain breath and meditate." 
Martí Dominguez published in the pages of El País around drawing skills in the art of Castejón: "Any exaggeration is objectionable, and to say that Joan Castejón is possibly the best Spanish artist who by now dominates human anatomy may seem a excess, but it is not." 
His exhibition "Per a Paca" visited many cities in Alicante between 2009 and 2010 as a tribute to his wife. According to the newspaper La Verdad it was "a retrospective of historical memories of the couple." 
Museology.
The largest public collection of works by Castejón is gathered at the Museum of Contemporary Art in his hometown Elche. The largest private collection was the collection Lecasse Foundation in Alcoy, containing about two hundred works acquired by businessman Lionel Grau Mullor during the eighties and nineties. Currently this collection was divided among his heirs. The collection of drawings dedicated to Don Quixote belong to the IVAM. Another good part of Parts is in the collection of Foundation Bancaja, Valencia.

James River (Missouri)

The James River is a 130 mi river in southern Missouri. Its source is near the town of Diggins in Webster County. It begins on a northwesterly course, then turns southwest near Northview. It passes down the east side of Springfield where a dam creates Lake Springfield. From Springfield, it flows west and then south to Galena. Shortly after Galena it enters Table Rock Lake. Before the dam that created Table Rock Lake, the James River emptied into the White River. 
Large sections of the James River are used by canoes or kayaks. A solid 3-day float from the spillway below Lake Springfield to Galena is possible when the levels are high enough. There are several access points along the river. These offer a variety of amenities including fishing and boat rentals. 
The James River is not a water source for the city of Springfield. However, Springfield Lake is a primary source of water for the cooling system at the Southeast Power Plant which sits by the dam. James River Freeway on the city's south side is named after the river. The river's unusual green stain is from copper-fixing bacteria present in the waters.

Big Bengt, the founder.
Big Bengt was born in 1922 in Brännehylte, Småland. His parents owned a forest farm and a wood mill. Big Bengt was involved in starting over 1000 companies. His interest in the Wild West was born from coming from a countryside where many had emigrated to America and from the stories they told. Bengt went to the United States himself in 1956 and in 4 months covered 4000 km. He came back to Sweden with a lot of impressions. When the Swedish national phone company had to get rid of 200,000 telephone poles, Bengt took the opportunity and constructed a fort. When many people started to get curious about the place, he realized its possibilities.

Compassion

Compassion is the response to the suffering of others that motivates a desire to help.
Compassion motivates people to go out of their way to help physical, spiritual, or emotional hurts or pains of another. In Latin "compassion" means "co-suffering." More involved than simple empathy, compassion commonly gives rise to an active desire to relieve someone's suffering. Pity and compassion are closely related words but have subtle differences. The difference is that compassion usually involves some commitment to help. Pity does not usually require any personal involvement.

It was released for the PlayStation on August 18, 2000 in North America and in 2000 in Europe, it was also released on the Dreamcast on December 30, 2000 in North America and on February 9, 2001 in Europe. It was the sequel to "ECW Hardcore Revolution" which was released six months earlier. Acclaim tried to make up for their last game by adding many new match types. Some of the matches that they added in were a Street Fight, Tables Match, Inferno Match, Dumpster Match, Lion's Den, Hate Match, and the Team Rumble. There was supposed to be a Nintendo 64 version but it was cancelled because console was approaching the end of production.
Reception.
IGN rated the game a 3.8 out of 10, saying "I'd recommend Anarchy Rulz only to ECW fans, and their reaction might only be to wonder where everything they liked about the promotion has gone". GameSpot gave the game a 5.5 out of 10 and stated "Things just don't feel quite right, and, even if you like the controls, the AI still cheats too much, the same boring combinations still lead to wins, and crowd involvement still takes precedence over inherent skill,"

Ghoti

Ghoti is an artificial word used to illustrate irregularities in English spelling. It is a respelling of the word "fish": i.e., it is supposed to be pronounced /ˈfɪʃ/. It is made of these phonemes:
Using the same method, "ghoti" can be a silent word, where:
In fact, "ghoti" is likely to be spontaneously pronounced [goʊtaɪ] or [gəʊtaɪ] (like "go" + "tie") but certainly not like "fish" since : "gh" is never pronounced [f] (cf. "ghost") at the beginning of a word neither "ti" is pronounced [ʃ] at the end of a word.

Gideon Mantell

Gideon Algernon Mantell MRCS FRS (Lewes, 3 February 1790 – London, 10 November 1852) was an English obstetrician, geologist and palaeontologist.
Mantell's work on the structure and life of "Iguanodon" began the scientific study of dinosaurs. In 1822 he was responsible for the discovery (and the eventual identification) of the first fossil teeth, and later much of the skeleton, of "Iguanodon". 
Mantell's work on the Cretaceous of southern England was also important. His phrase the "Age of Reptiles" was significant. He recognised that that reptiles were the dominant life-form in what we now call the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
Mantell did two things which were most important. He showed that the teeth of "Iguanodon" meant it must be a herbivore, and its shorter front legs meant it could be bipedal (walk on two legs). This was denied by Richard Owen, who did a good deal to hide Mantell's achievements.
At the end of Mantell's life he suffered terribly from damage to his spine caused by an accident. He took an overdose of opium, which caused his death. It is not known whether he did this deliberately; he took opium to dull the pain.
Works by Mantell.
Sixty-seven books and memoirs appear in Agassiz and Strickland's "Bibliographia Zoologiæ", and forty-eight scientific papers in the Royal Society's Catalogue.

William Buckland

William Buckland DD FRS (12 March 1784 – 14 August 1856) was an English theologian who became Dean of Westminster. He was also a geologist and palaeontologist.
Buckland wrote the first full account of a fossil dinosaur, which he named "Megalosaurus". He proved that Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire had been a prehistoric hyena den, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society. He was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past. He was a pioneer in the use of fossilized faeces (he coined the term coprolites) to reconstruct ancient ecosystems.
In 1818, Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He became Reader in Geology at Oxford University in 1819. His work "Reliquiæ Diluvianæ" was published in 1823 and became a best seller. 
However, over the next decade Buckland changed his mind. In his famous Bridgewater Treatise, "Geology and mineralogy considered with reference to natural theology", he said that the biblical account of Noah's flood could not be confirmed using geological evidence. What had been taken as evidence of the 'Universal Deluge' two decades before was, he thought, evidence of a major glaciation.
Not only was Buckland's home filled with specimens – animal as well as mineral, live as well as dead – but he claimed to have eaten much of the animal kingdom, a practice known as zoöphagy.

Oxygen saturation

Oxygen saturation or dissolved oxygen (DO) is a relative measure of the amount of oxygen that is dissolved in a given medium. It can be measured with a dissolved oxygen such as an oxygen sensor. Or it can be measured with an optode in liquid media, usually water. The standard unit is milligrams per litre (mg/l) or parts per million (ppm). Fish, invertebrates, plants, and aerobic bacteria all require oxygen (dissolved in water) for respiration. In medicine, oxygen saturation refers to "oxygenation". This means when oxygen molecules (O2) enter the tissues of the body.

Albert Heijn (AH) is the biggest supermarket business in the Netherlands. It has stores in many other countries. It was founded by Jan Heijn. 
The beginning.
The supermarket chain began as a small spice shop in Oostzan owned by Jan Heijn. In 1887 his son, Albert Heijn (b. 1865), took over the store and added home made cookies and coffee. Eight years later Heijn opened the new stores in Purmerend and in Zaandam. He continued to increase the range of goods, and to increase the number of shops. By 1910 he was operating ten shops. He later started selling goods branded with his name. 
The Supermarket.
The supermarket part of the business was developed by Albert Heijn's son, also called Albert Heijm (b. 1927). In 1952 the first self service store was opened in the Netherlands. Customers were able to pick their own groceries off the shelf and put them into baskets. The number of shops began to increase. They published a shop magazine, Allerhande, with articles about food from 1954. In 1955 they started a loyalty scheme were people were given a stamp for each guilder they spent in the store. These stamps could be traded for further goods.
Products.
Their slogan is “to make the ordinary affordable and the extra-ordinary attainable”. Albert Heijn stocks four brands, Albert Hein basic which is cheap, Albert Heijn, the normal brand and Albert Heijn excellent which is best quality. In this way almost everyone can afford their prices. There is also an other brand called: puur&eerlijk. This means that the animals have been caught legally, the food is bought fair and the animals have had a good life with more space and better food. By 2014 Albert Heijn has over 930 stores and a web store. You can recognize them by their blue/white ‘AH’ logo. They have good marketing and have lots of commercials onj TV, especially in the Netherlands.
Ahold.
Alberts Heijns is now run by a company called Ahold. This is a Dutch international retailer based in Amsterdam. Its first founded company was Albert Heijn. In 1987 Ahold N.V. received the title “Royal” from the Dutch Queen Beatrix. Ahold has shops in Europe including:

The northern borders of the Republic of India are mostly in the same place as the Himalayan mountain range, except for the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir where the country borders the Tibet Autonomous Region. The North-east Indian regional zone also borders the disputed territory of the Chinese claimed area of South Tibet, as well as the Kingdoms of Bhutan and Sikkim. Its western international border with Pakistan is in the Punjab Plain, divided by the Radcliffe Line and the Thar Desert. 
On the south, India projects into and is bordered by the Indian Ocean – in particular, by the Arabian Sea on the southwest, the Laccadive Sea to the south, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. The Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar separates South India from Sri Lanka to its southeast, and the Maldives are 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the southwest. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) southeast of the mainland, share borders in the sea with Burma, Thailand and Indonesia. To the east it borders Burma that is separated by the forested mountain regions and the longest border is with Bangladesh that forms an enclave (special area) on the East Indian regional zone, it naturally forms the watershed region of the North Indian Plain, which also includes southern Nepal.

William Rosecrans (September 6, 1819 – March 11, 1898) was a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was born in 1819 in Ohio. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842 and became an engineer. He resigned from the army in 1854 and became a businessman.
When the Civil War started, Rosecrans rejoined the army. He became a Brigadier general in May 1861. He commanded a brigade during the Western Virginia Campaign. He commanded the Union units in West Virginia for a while before being transferred to the Western Theater in May 1862.
In October 1862, Rosecrans became commander of the Army of the Cumberland. His first battle as army commander was at the Battle of Stones River from December 31, 1862 to January 2, 1863. The Union army won the battle. During the summer of 1863, Rosecrans then captured the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. But he lost the Battle of Chickamauga in September, which forced him to retreat to Chattanooga. The Confederates surrounded the city and started a siege. Union president Abraham Lincoln and Major General U.S. Grant, who commanded all Union armies in the Western Theater, didn't think Rosecrans could defend the city. So Rosecrans was fired as commander of the Army of the Cumberland and sent to Missouri.
Rosecrans resigned from the army again in 1867 and went back into business. In 1881 he was elected to the House of Representatives from California. He died in 1898 in California. Rosecrans has a national cemetery in San Diego, California named after him.

Lake Anna

Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in the US state of Virginia. It covers an area of 13,000 acres (53 km²). Lake Anna is 72 miles (116 km) south of Washington, D.C. in Louisa and Spotsylvania counties. The lake is easy to get to from Richmond and Charlottesville. Lake Anna is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state.
History.
In 1829 gold was discovered in Louisa county. In the 1880s gold mining reached its peak. The Goodman gold mine is the site that later became Lake Anna. The reservoir is formed by the North Anna Dam on the North Anna River at . In 1968, Virginia Electric and Power Company (now Dominion) purchased 18,000 acres (73 km²) of farmlands in three counties along the North Anna and Pamunkey Rivers. They planned to provide clean, fresh water to cool the nuclear power generating plants at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station next to the lake. By 1972 the lake bottom was cleared of all trees and the dam was almost finished. It was thought it would take three years to completely fill the lake. But with the additional rainfall from Hurricane Agnes, the lake was full in only 18 months. The first communities were started at about that same time. Now there are about 120 different communities on the shores of the lake. In March 1986, construction on the dam's 1 megawatt hydroelectric power plant began. The two generators went into commercial operation in December 1987.
Description.
Lake Anna is about 17 mi long from tip to tip. It has some 200 miles (300 km) of shoreline. The lake is divided into two sides: the public side (also known as the "cold" side) and the private side (also known as the "hot" side). The public side is roughly 9,000 acres (36 km²), while the private side is roughly 4,000 acres (16 km²). The private side is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by navigable canals. The public and private sides are divided by three stone dikes. The private side has no marinas or public access ramps. Only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the private side. The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees much higher boat traffic than the private side, especially on summer weekends.
The public side is called the "cold" side because it provides water to cool the generators at the power plant. The private or "hot" side receives warm water discharge from the power plant. The private side can be much warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point. There it can be too hot for swimming. The private side has an extended water sports season. Some water circulates back out of the private side into the public side through underground channels. As a result the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish move to these warmer waters.
Plans for an addition of a third reactor have raised protests from environmentalists and property owners. They fear it will increase in the water temperature and lower the water level, particularly on the private side. According to Dominion, the water discharged from the plant is usually about 14 degrees F warmer than the intake water.
North Anna Dam.
The dam creating the lake, North Anna Dam, is a 5000 ft long and 90 ft high earthen embankment dam. It is 30 ft wide at its top which sits at an elevation of 265 ft above sea level. The dam's spillway is located in the center of its body. Normal elevation for the reservoir is 250 ft. The dam's hydroelectric power plant is located on the west side of the spillway. It is supplied with water via a 5 ft diameter penstock. It has a combined installed capacity of 1 MW.
Fishing.
Lake Anna is one of the finest Largemouth bass fishing lakes in Virginia. Besides largemouth, there are striped bass, crappie, channel catfish, walleye and several species of sunfish. Because of the warm water and low Oxygen saturation the striped bass have to be stocked in Lake Anna. The walleye population has a similar problem and must also be stocked. Lake Anna has very good numbers of channel catfish, with many averaging 3 pounds. Because of the warm waters, Lake Anna can be fished all year long. It is a very popular recreational lake that offers boating, Water skiing and Jet Skiing. As a result, Lake Anna gets "very" crowded. Fishermen resort to early morning and late night fishing when all the other users are off the lake.

Tenrec

The tenrec is a mammal of the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. 
Tenrecs are varied. As a result of convergent evolution, they look like hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and underground habitats. Some of these species can be found in the Madagascar's dry deciduous forests.
Although they may resemble shrews, hedgehogs, or otters, they are not closely related to any of these groups. Their closest relatives are other African, insectivorous mammals such as golden moles and elephant shrews. The common ancestry of these animals, together with aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, and sea cows in the group Afrotheria, was not recognized until the late 1990s. Work on the diversity of afrotherian mammals has provided more support for their common ancestry.
Unusual among placental mammals, the anus and urogenital tracts of tenrecs share a common opening, or cloaca, a feature more commonly seen in birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They have low body temperatures, sufficiently so that they do not require a scrotum to cool their sperm as most other mammals do.

Golden mole

Golden moles are small, insectivorous burrowing mammals native to southern Africa. They form the family Chrysochloridae. They are taxonomically distinct from the true moles. They look alike because of convergent evolution. 
The golden moles bear a remarkable resemblance to the marsupial moles of Australia. They live almost exclusively underground, beneath grassland, forest, swamps, deserts, or mountainous terrain. Like several other burrowing mammals with similar habits, they have short legs with powerful digging claws, very dense fur that repels dirt and moisture, and tough skin, particularly on the head. Their eyes do not work, and covered with skin and fur. The ears are just tiny openings and, like the marsupial moles, they have an enlarged leather-like pad to protect their nostrils. Their main sense is that of touch, and they are particularly sensitive to vibrations that may indicate approaching danger.

Battle of Bunker Hill

The Battle of Bunker Hill was a battle in the American War of Independence. It took place on June 17, 1775, mostly on and around Breed's Hill, during the Siege of Boston early in the American Revolutionary War. The battle is named after Bunker Hill, which is close and which was involved in the battle. Bunker Hill was the original objective of both colonial and British troops. Sometimes, the battle is called the "Battle of Breed's Hill."
On June 13, 1775, the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British generals were planning to send troops out from the city to occupy the unoccupied hills around the city. In response to this, 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill, constructed an earthen redoubt on Breed's Hill, and built lightly fortified lines across most of the Charlestown Peninsula.
When the British were alerted to the presence of the new position the next day, they mounted an attack against them. After two assaults on the colonial lines were repulsed with significant British casualties, the British finally captured the positions on the third assault, after the defenders in the redoubt ran out of ammunition. The colonial forces retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill, suffering their most significant losses on Bunker Hill.
Even though the British forces won the battle, they suffered heavy losses: over 800 people were wounded and 226 were killed, among them many officers. For this reason, the battle is seen as an example of a Pyrrhic victory: the immediate gain (the capture of Bunker Hill) was small and did not change the state of the siege very much, but the cost was high. Nearly a third of the deployed forces were either wounded or killed. Meanwhile, colonial forces were able to retreat and regroup in good order because they had suffered fewer casualties. Furthermore, the battle demonstrated that relatively inexperienced colonial forces were willing and able to stand up to regular army troops in a pitched battle.

Greater Vancouver Zoo

The Greater Vancouver Zoo is a zoo in Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada. It has 49 ha.
History.
They first started in the late 1960s after businessman Pat Hines bought 120 acres (49 ha) in Aldergrove, British Columbia to start a game farm. They opened to the public on August 20, 1970 and were originally known as Vancouver Game Farm. The first animal to arrive there was a llama named "Dennis", who came from Mount Vernon, Washington. The facility was sold in 1991 and was renamed the "Greater Vancouver Zoological Centre" in 1995. After the sale, they built new animal enclosures, a miniature train ride, a picnic park, more landscaping, a remodeled entrance, more parking spaces, informational and educational programs and activities. Ownership changed in 1999 and the zoo was renamed "Greater Vancouver Zoo". The new owners focused on conservation and improving their educational programs.
On May 31, 2006, formal charges were laid against the zoo by the Crown Counsel of British Columbia, in accordance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act because they failed to provide acceptable facilities for a baby hippo named "Hazina" that they acquired in October 2004. It was they first time that a major Canadian zoo was charged with cruelty to animals. The case was stayed in January 2007 when crown counsel believed that with the opening of a new habitat for hippos, that it was no longer in the public interest. The zoo lost its Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums accreditation for two years before regaining it back in 2012.

Thermal radiation is radiation that can be seen as either heat or light. It is a form of heat transfer that is moved from one place to another by electromagnetic radiation. It does not require a form of matter to be transferred.
For example a person in front of a fire can warm up because of the light of the fire, even if the air is cold.
Another example of thermal radiation is the heat that comes from the Sun to the Earth.

Solenodon

Solenodons (meaning "slotted-tooth") are venomous, nocturnal mammals in the family Solenodontidae. They are burrowing insectivores
There is only one genus, "Solenodon", They are interesting because they keep some primitive mammal characteristics. Their species resemble closely those which lived near the end of the age of the dinosaurs.
The two living solenodon species are the Cuban Solenodon ("Solenodon cubanus"), and the Haitian or Hispaniolan Solenodon ("Solenodon paradoxus"). The Hispaniolan solenodon lives in many habitats on the island of Hispaniola from lowland dry forest to highland pine forest. Two other described species went extinct during the Quaternary. Oligocene North American genera, such as "Apternodus", have been suggested as relatives of "Solenodon".

Coracle

The coracle is a small, lightweight boat. They were used in Wales, parts of Western and South West England, Ireland, and Scotland The word is also to describe similar boats from India, Vietnam, Iraq and Tibet. The word "coracle" comes from the Welsh word "cwrwgl." This is related to the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word "currach." It is recorded in English as early as the 16th century. Other old English spellings include "corougle", "corracle", "curricle" and "coricle".
Structure.
 Coracles on the River Teifi, West Wales 1972.
 An Indian coracle near the River Tungabhadra, in Hampi India
 Indian coracles are used on the Kabini River, Karnataka, India
 A typical River Teifi coracle in Manordeifi Old Church
 The Ku-Dru or Kowa of Tibet is very similar to a coracle—Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago 
Corricles are oval in shape, and look like half a walnut shell. They are made with a framework of split willow branches, twisted together and tied with willow bark. Originally the outer layer was an animal skin from a horse or bullock. These skins were covered with a thin layer of tar to make them keep the water out. Today coracles are made with calico or canvas covered in tar, or simply fibreglass. The Asian coracle is made differently. It uses bamboo and the water is kept out with a layer of resin and coconut oil. The coracle does not have a keel. The flat bottom allows the weight of the boat and its load to be spread evenly. This means it does not need much water to float – as little as a few inches, making it ideal for use on rivers.
Coracles have different designs, as they are designed for the river conditions where they are built and used. The Teifi coracle is flat-bottomed, because it is designed for use in the shallow rapids which common on the river in the summer. The Carmarthen coracle is rounder and deeper, because it is used in tidal waters on the Tywi, where there are no rapids. Teifi coracles are made from local wood. They use willow for the body of the boat, called a lats. Hazel is used for the bit around the top, called Y bleth in Welsh. Tywi coracles have been made from sawn ash for a long time. These days working boats are made from fibreglass. Teifi coracles do not use nails. The twisting together of the lats makes them strong. The Carmarthen coracles use copper nails and are not twisted together.
Coracles are good for fishing because they do not disturb the water or the fish. They can be controlled easily with one arm, while the other arm manages the net; two coracles to a net. The coracle is moved with a broad-bladed paddle. These are also have different designs between different rivers. It is used in a sculling action. The blade makes a figure-of-eight pattern in the water. The paddle is used towards the front of the coracle, pulling the boat forward, with the paddler facing in the direction of travel.
A Welsh Coracle can be carried by a person on their back. 'Llwyth dyn ei gorwgl' — the load of a man is his coracle. (Welsh saying).
History.
The coracle was designed to be used in the quickly flowing streams of Wales and parts of the rest of Britain and Ireland. Coracles are very old, Julius Caesar saw them in Britain in the 1st century BC. Archaeologists believe they have discovered the remains of a coracle in a Bronze Age grave at Barns Farm near Dalgety Bay. Others have been discovered at Corbridge and near Ferriby.
Coracles are so light that they can easily be carried on the fisherman's shoulders. Coracle fishing is performed by two coraclers. The net is stretched across the river between the two coracles. These are paddled with one handed and the net is dragged down the river in the other. When a fish is caught, each fisherman pulls up an end of the net until the two coracles are brought to touch, and the fish is grabbed and put into the boat.
Today.
Coracles are not used much these days. They can be seen in tourist areas of West Wales, and sometimes in Shropshire on the River Severn. There is a public house in Sundorne, Shrewsbury called "The Coracle". It has a sign showing a man using a coracle on a river. The Welsh Rivers Teifi and Tywi are the best places to find coracles in Wales. On the Teifi they are usually seen between Cenarth, Cilgerran and Llechryd.
In 1974 Bernard Thomas of Llechryd crossed the English Channel to France in 13½ hours in a coracle. The journey showed how the Bull Boats of the Mandan Indians of North Dakota could have been copied from coracles introduced by Prince Madog in the 12th century.
For many years until 1979, Shrewsbury coracle maker Fred Davies became famous among football fans. He would sit in his coracle during Shrewsbury Town FC home matches at Gay Meadow, and get the footballs that landed in the River Severn. Although Davies died in 1994, his legend is still linked to the club.
The Coracle Society.
The Coracle Society is a UK-based organisation, started by its president, Sir Peter Badge in 1990. The society wanted:
There are many Society members across the country who show the coracle at events and/or run coracle building courses. Terry Kenny, the current chairman of the Society, runs several courses each year at the Green Wood Centre. Some of this year's events are listed on the .
The Society was present at the 2005 Shrewsbury River Festival, where they had various coracles on the River Severn. There is also an Annual Coracle Regatta held in Ironbridge on the August Bank Holiday Monday every year. It is organised by the Green Wood Centre. Anyone with a coracle can take part in the event. Each year new people come with coracles which they have made on the Bank Holiday weekend at the Green Wood Centre with local coracle maker Terry Kenny.
The third Coracle Challenge, which raises funds in support of Macmillan Cancer Support took place in Shrewsbury on 19 May 2009.
Safety.
The coracle is an unstable craft. Because it sits "on" the water, rather than "in" it, the vessel can easily be carried by currents and the wind. The Coracle Society has written a guide for safely using coracles.
Similar craft.
The oldest instructions for building a coracle are on a 4000 year-old cuneiform clay tablet. This was dictated by the Mesopotamian god Enki to Atra-Hasis on how to build a round "ark". The tablet is about 2,250 years older than than the flood myths, none of which contain such details. The earliest known written evidence of a coracle-type boat (quffa), still in use today, is in the Bible, Exodus 2:3.
The Irish curach (also "currach" or "curragh") is a similar, but larger, vessel still in use today. Curachs were also used in the west of Scotland:
The currachs in the River Spey were very similar to Welsh coracles. Other related craft include:

Polecat

Not to be confused with :Skunk.
Polecat is the common name for several medium-sized Mustelids. They do not form a single clade: the name is given to several similar species. 
The European polecat is typical, and is the only one native to the British Isles. Ferrets are the domesticated form of European polecats.
In the U.S., the term "polecat" is often applied to skunks, which are only distantly related to the European polecat. The reason is that polecats give off a scent which some people think is offensive.

Movie release

A movie release (or premiere) is when a completed movie is released for the public to see. It may be in theaters or for home viewing. A movie's release date can affect how much money the movie makes. 
Marketing.
A movie's release date and how it is released is a part of the marketing of the movie. Often a movie will be tested on selected audiences to see how they like it. This is called a limited release. A movie might also be shown first at a film festival to see how it does. If an audience does not like something, the moviemakers can make changes before it is released to the public. 
Movie studios limit the number of major movies they release in a year. They also try not to release a major movie at the same time another studio does. The timing of when a movie is released can affect how much money it makes. When "A Little Princess" was released in 1995, the movie "Pocahontas" was released at the same time. Even worse (for revenues), both were aimed at the same target audience.
Movie calendar.
There were traditional times of the year for releases of certain types of movies. Summer was the traditional time to release blockbuster movies. These are large budget movies with a great deal of publicity. Spring was the usual time for art films. Another major time of the year to release major movies is Christmas. Lately, however, the movie calendar has become very crowded with more new releases. This means that blockbuster movies now come out all during the year.
Prints and advertising.
A print is a copy of the physical film itself. Each movie theater needs a print for showing. This becomes expensive and along with advertising they are called 'P&A'. Advertising can include parties for the stars of the movie. It can also mean arranging interviews on talk shows and placing movie clips on video sharing websites like YouTube. This is to get people talking about the movie. The period of time for advertising a movie only a few weeks before it is released. After that time it is hoped will advertise the movie. 
The movie "Four Weddings and a Funeral" was released in the United States in 1994. The distributor, Polygram, had a limited P&A budget. They released the movie on a limited basis, in New York and Los Angeles. They spent heavily on advertising in these cities hoping the limited release would be a success. In this case it was and they used the profits to gradually release the movie all over the country. This is called a 'platform release'. It allows smaller movie studios to compete with the large P&A budgets of the big studios.

Wales Coast Path

The Wales Coast Path (Welsh: "Llwybr Arfordir Cymru" 
 
) is a long-distance footpath which follows the whole coastline of Wales. It opened on 5 May 2012. It is 870 mi long, from Chepstow in the south to Queensferry in the north.
Wales is the first country in the world to build a footpath along its entire coastline. The Path runs through eleven National Nature Reserves and other nature reserves, including those managed by The Wildlife Trusts or Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Lonely Planet rated the coast of Wales first in its Best in Travel: top 10 regions for 2012.
Description.
The Wales Coast Path was opened on 5 May 2012, as the world's first coastal path to cover an entire country. It follows the Welsh coastline from Chepstow in the south east to near Queensferry in the north. It joined together some existing paths, such as the North Wales Path, the Anglesey Coastal Path and the Llŷn Coastal Path. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is a National Trail. and in 2011 was voted by National Geographic magazine as the second-best coastal destination in the world.
The 870 mi long path goes through different coastal areas. These include the mouth of the River Dee, the seaside towns of north Wales, the Menai Strait, the Isle of Anglesey, the Llŷn Peninsula, Cardigan Bay, miles of sand in the National Park in Pembrokeshire, Gower, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff, and Chepstow.
The whole path can be used by walkers. Some sections can also be used by cyclists, families with pushchairs, people with restricted mobility, and horse riders.
The Countryside Council for Wales (now Natural Resources Wales) set up the path, and each of 15 local government areas it passes through look after their own section. There were already five coastal paths, in Pembrokeshire, Anglesey, Gwynedd, Ceredigion and the North Wales coast. These became five of the eight geographical areas that now make up the path. The other three areas are made up of single and combined counties and county boroughs with coastlines.
History and development.
The Wales Coast Path was set up by the Welsh Government with the former Countryside Council for Wales, sixteen local authorities and two National Parks. Since 2007 the Welsh Government has spent £2 million per year to improve public access to the coast through its Coastal Access Improvement Programme. The European Regional Development Fund has also given £3.9 million over three years to support the project.
The idea for the path was based on the success of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail and the Isle of Anglesey Coastal Path. Plans for the path were shown by First Minister Rhodri Morgan in June 2006, at the opening of the 125-mile path around Anglesey. It was thought the project would take up to five years; it has been nearer six. Visitors to the Pembrokeshire and Anglesey coastal paths bring a lot of money into Wales. It was also seen as an important to encourage both locals and visitors to discover and enjoy Wales’ outdoor spaces, also gain health and welfare benefits from walking.
The Countryside Council for Wales said that improvements to the path would continue during 2012 and 2013. The path will follow the coastline as close as it is safe and practical. The completed path is expected to lead to making shorter circular paths, linking to inland towns and villages.
The opening.
The official opening of the 870 mi path took place in a number of places on 5 May 2012. These places showed the path’s beauty and ease of access for walkers of all ages, fitness and ability. To celebrate the opening, Ramblers Cymru, hosted the Big Welsh Coastal Walk, with over 5,500 people taking part. 
Northern Eye Books are writing the Official Guidebooks for five sections of the Wales Coast Path: North Wales Coast, Isle of Anglesey, Llyn Peninsula, Carmarthenshire and Gower, and the South Wales Coast. They already publish the Official Guide for Anglesey, "Walking the Isle of Anglesey Coastal Path" by Carl Rogers. There are also guidebooks to the Ceredigion Coast Path and the Pembrokeshire Coast Path by other publishers.
The first anniversary of the opening of the path was marked on radio and television. It is estimated that in that first year some 2.8 million people walked parts of the path, adding £16 million to the Welsh economy. It is estimated that more than 800,000 visitors to the path also stayed the night in one of the many guest-houses, B&B's and hotels along the route.
A complete walk around Wales.
The 870 mi of the Wales Coast Path joins the Offa's Dyke Path National Trail. This path follows the border with England, to make a 1030 miwalking path around almost the whole of Wales.
Problems.
The Open Spaces Society is angry because some landowners will not allow the path to cross their land. This means 170 mi – more than 20% of the route – will have to be on roads, sometimes out of sight of the sea. A Countryside Council for Wales spokeswoman said: “Just over 20% of the WCP is on road, slightly less than the average for national trails in Britain, which is in the region of 25%. This is mainly on quiet, country lanes.”
In 2014 there was a temporary road route north of Cardigan, connecting Gwbert with Mwnt. The Ceredigion Coast Path section in that area could not be used because of legal actions.
Walkers have a view overlooking a gypsy caravan site at Rover Way in Cardiff. People living here are worried about their privacy.

The United States in the 19th century

The United states was a country in the 19th century. During this time it grew from 17 states to 45 states. The year was from 1801 till 1900 in the Gregorian calendar. States like Utah, Illinois and Mississippi were added to the United States. There were 22 presidents. The Industrial Revolution was still going on. The first skyscraper was built and the White House became the home of the President of the United States. There was a war with Great Britain in 1812. In 1866 Alfred Nobel invented dynamite. The sport of Basketball was invented. In 1829, William Austin Burt patented a machine called the "Typographer" which many consider the first typewriter. The 19th century also saw the Great Chicago Fire. New York City was hit by the Great September Gale of 1815. 
Presidents in the United States 19th century.
The United States of America had 22 presidents in the 19th Century. Thomas Jefferson was the third President of the United States. He was the first elected president of the 19th century. The last one was William McKinley. McKinley started the presidency in 1897 and he left his presidency in 1901 which is just after the 19th century. All these presidents in the 19th century lived in the white house. 
Thomas Jefferson.
Thomas Jefferson was born on the 13th of April in 1743. His parents were Jane Randolph Jefferson and Peter Jefferson. His brothers were Peter and Randolph. His sisters were Jane, Mary, Elizabeth, Marta, Lucy and Anna. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. He was president from 1801 till 1809. He died on July 5, 1826 and was buried at Monticello.
Abraham Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln was born on 12 February 1809. This was while Thomas Jefferson was president. He was the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln. He was born in the state of Kentucky. Lincoln married Mary Todd. His children were Robert, Edward, Willie and Tad. Lincoln belonged to the Whig Party and later the Republican Party. He was assassinated while still in office. 
Martin van Buren.
Martin van Buren was born on December 5, 1782. He was born in Kinderhook, New York, US. His father was Abraham van Buren and his mother was Maria Hoes van Alen van Buren. His ancestor Cornelis van Buren had come to the United States in 1631 from the small city of Buren. Martin is the only president who has spoken English as a second language. His political party was called the Free Soil Party. Martin was president from 1837 till 1841. He died on July 24, 1862.
James Monroe.
James Monroe was born on April 28,1758 in Virginia. His parents were Spence Monroe and Elizabeth. James Monroe married Elizabeth Kortright. Their children were Eliza, James and Maria. He died on July 4, 1831 in New York City. He was then 73 years old.
The Industrial Revolution.
The transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy took more than a century in the United States, they lagged far behind their mother country, England. The Industrial Revolution started around 1750 in England, and fifty years later in the United States. This was because there was a lot of land to work on, but there was too less labour to do that. The industrial machines were expensive.
Samuel Slater.
The start of the Industrial Revolution in America is caused by Samuel Slater, who built the first industrial mill in the United States around 1790. His cotton mill looked a lot like the British mill. But through this mill, the speed with which cotton thread could be spun into yarn was greatly increased.
Another cause of the rapidly changing economy were the new organizational strategies to increase the speed to make the products. This reformation was especially important for the shoe and boot industry. Were first the most products were made by hand.
But the most important change was the “Factory System” where products were produced on a large scale and then one specific product, but they needed people to operate the machines. A group of businessman called the Boston Associates recruited thousands farm girls from New England to operate the machines in the new factories.
Lowell.
One of the most known mill towns was Lowell, Massachusetts, which opened in 1823. The use of a female factory workers had advantages to both employer and employee. The Boston Associates preferred the young girls because they paid young girls less than men. These female factory workers were often called: Lowell Girls, named to the place Lowell.

Decline of Napoleon

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Napoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769 on the island of Corsica. No one knew that this child would have such a big influence on French in the future, because his parents were from nobility but they were not so rich . Napoleon grew up in a large family with four brothers and three sisters, his parents were Letitia Carlo Bonaparte and his brothers were named : Giuiseppe, Luciano, Luigi and Gerolamo and his sisters were: Elisha, Paola and Carolina. At 15 he went to officer candidate training in Paris and at 16 he already finished the training , so that proved that he was a quick learner . He has also been on the royal military school in Briene . In 1789 the revolution broke out when Napoleon was only 20 , he had an opinion, he was not against the Revolution , but he thought that the people should not use violence he also found that the king was well behaved . In 1795 the revolution stops and Louis XVI beheaded . When Napoleon then entered the army , it's all faster than expected . He falls to Italy in the Apennines . The victory should soon be a reality , and that's the end , even after 96 hours and 5 battles .
Napoleon is known for victories and peace , he is also depicted on his first portrait as a conqueror. In 1798, Napoleon went to England but was unsuccessful because England was difficult to attack. Napoleon also went to Egypt with 50,000. When he came back from Egypt, his wife (Josephine) had a surprise for him, even the house: "ma maison". When he arrived in the national assembly, he first got a lot of criticism, but because his brother was the chairman of that meeting, Napoleon got the power. In 1800, a bomb aimed at Napoleon, four years later, there is somebody arrested. In 1801, Napoleon signed the Concordat with the Catholic Church and Napoleon also made the Civil Code. 
Napoleon as a 1st consul, may only get advice from the other two consuls, so basically he has all power. But the highlight of his career was in the year 1804 in this year he crowns himself Emperor of France. This indicated that he had a pretty high self-esteem otherwise he would be crowned by someone else he crowns his wife as Empress. In his time as emperor, he founded a legion of honour there are 30,000 people from all over France, because of this you got a good pension. But all good things come to an end and Napoleon is captured in one day by the British and exiled to an island called St. Helena where he spent his last years. What is certain is that he is deceased on the island of St. Helena in 1821.
How did Napoleon seize power in Europe?
As he did not come from an important noble family , he would never have made it very far in an estate society. But thanks to the revolution his career went fast. After the revolution many old noble officers fled or were dismissed and beheaded. As a result young fighters like napoleon had all kinds of opportunities. In 1796 Napoleon was already a general and he led the campaign to Italy. Napoleon’s troops were not well armed , but they did have something else: they were eager to fight. This applied to all French troops. Because of the revolution the French army had become a fierce war machine.
Decline of Napoleon.
1.France started to spread their nationalism.
2.Napoleon saw that Great Britain was becoming stronger and had survived all changes. He made up a plan named " The Continental System". It consisted in making Great Britain weak. He stopped the trade with Great Britain. Great Britain’s navy was better than France's, so his plan did not work.
3. Russia was not happy with Napoleon's decisions. Out of frustration Napoleon invaded Russia. With half a million soldiers Napoleon went to Moscow in the summer of 1812. But the Russians had a good tactic, they knew they could never defeat such an enormous army. They continued to retreat, but destroyed all food supplies so the French would not be able to find anything to eat. When Napoleon finally arrived in Moscow in September. But there was no Moscow, it was nearly desert. So Napoleon needed to leave empty-handed. The winter started to retreat him. Hundreds of thousands of men and horses died of hunger, exhaustion and frost. This event was also said to be the beginning of the end.
4. The Battle of Leipzig or Battle of Nations, on 16-19 October 1813, was fought by the coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden against the French army of Napoleon. Napoleon's army also contained Polish and Italian troops and Germans of the Rhine Confederation. In the struggle over 600,000 soldiers were involved and it was thus the largest battle in Europe before the First World War. 
5. Napoleon was defeated and forced to return to France. Napoleon was forced to retreat 00.and Napoleon was banned to Elba. But Napoleon managed to escape, and again he seized power in Paris. After this he decided to attacked Waterloo, he was finally defeated in this Battle. Napoleon was banned to Saint Helena, a British island between Africa and South America. There he died in 1821
Consequences Napoleons rule in the Netherlands.
Napoleon made a lot of changes in a short period of time:
Poverty was increasing. In 1811, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte visited the Netherlands , and was still greeted friendly , but when it brought military service to the Netherland, the people started to revolt . Indeed, it was unfair that only the rich could buy someone else to send in addition. 
When France announced that all the men between 20 and 80 years old had to defend the Dutch coast , the people really started to revolt.
The rich people also started to revolt , when the new service Gardes d'Honneur was introduced and this service could not be bought .
A storm of protest and rebellion arose . The Cossacks came to the Netherlands to expel the French armies and the Dutch took control of Prince William of Orange. William VI , came from England to the Netherlands on November 30 1813, and was crowned as King William I .
The Netherlands was under the rule of French for 18 years

History of rail transport in the Netherlands

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
History of rail transport in the Netherlands On the 20th of September 1839, the first train trip went through the Netherlands. It was a short trip from Amsterdam to Haarlem. The Train was called the Arend which was a type of steam locomotive. The history of the Dutch railways, the 6 era’s, was up to 1839. The planning for railways, 1840-1860 the early expansion of the railways. In the period 1860-1890 the government paid the making of the new railways. From 1890-1938 the railways strengthen into 2 large railways. 1938-1992 In this period the 'Nederlandse Spoorwegen' had in monopoly in the train industry. 1992-present The 'Nederlandse Spoorwegen' lost their monopoly. 
1839.
The beginning of a good railway in the Netherlands.
The first modern railway was built in England in 1830. It ran from Liverpool to Manchester. A Dutch artillery officer, William A. Bake, was there when it opened. When Bake came back to the Netherlands he made plans to connect Amsterdam to Amersfoort, and Amersfoort to Arnhem. King William supported Bake's plan. Unfortunately, his timing was bad. So was his plan to finance the railroad. Dutch businessmen did not want to invest their money at that time. They were worried about their investments in Spain. With no money, his plan did not work.
The start of the railways.
Luckily due the king, the railways got an upgrade, so they were more safe. The new railways could fit in the soil of the Netherlands. The railway track connected Liverpool to Manchester and you can already guess who made it. Since this railway track was the build the ideas of railroads spread across Europe. Belgium and Germany started t
o copy those railway tracks and King William I from the Netherlands couldn’t stay behind.
In the Netherlands.
He let engineers do research if the railroad system was possible in the Netherlands. But it was difficult to pay the railway tracks etc. The king made his decision on the 8th of August 1837. The Dutch government would pay the new way of transportation. After 2 years the first railway company was founded. It was called the: ‘Hollandse Ijzeren Spoorweg Maatschappij (HIJSM). They began with the construction of the railway track that connected Amsterdam and Haarlem. The first steam locomotive who drove on this track was a small locomotive called ‘de Arend’.
1840-1860.
The expansion.
After the success of the first railway track that connected Amsterdam to Haarlem. The railroads started to expand and a new railway company was found. It was called the ‘Nederlandse Rhijnspoorweg Maatschappij’ (NSR). They both made the new railroad to Rotterdam The railway would cross everything. 
The railway to Rotterdam.
The NSR and the HIJSM bought every piece of land to proceed. But some landowners and farmers didn’t like the idea of a railway crossing their farm, because it could frighten the cows. There was even a big incident that happened while making a railway track that connected Amsterdam to Rotterdam. A land owner called Aernout Hendrik van Wickenvoort Crommelin only wanted to sell his piece of land if a train station was built favorable for him. The HIJSM and NSR didn’t like that so they tried to make the railway track go around his piece of land. Unfortunately it failed. Still Aernout had given them some land to continue. The NSR and HIJSM lost a lot of money on this incident and it was later called: ‘Het laantje van van der Gaag'. The railroad was finished in 1847.
The first railway of the NSR.
The NSR also wanted to built a railway by their self. This railway would go from Amsterdam to Utrecht to Arnhem and then on to Germany. The making of it didn’t went really well because they couldn’t find enough investors. But luckily was our King William I again the savior of the railroads. But there was a problem with the constructing of the railway because the Dutch railways were built on Dutch broad gauge and the connection in Germany was made on standard gauge. The railroad to Utrecht was finished on December 18, 1843, The next stretch to Arnhem on May, 16 1845. The final stretch to Germany took 11 years because the other part of the railroad had to be made in Standard gauge.
1860-1890.
The 'Spoorwegnet'.
In 1860 the ‘Spoorwegnet’ was found. It’s a system that connects all the cities with railways built by the government. The citizens of the cities founded that their city must be connected to the Spoorwegnet because otherwise their city would lose popularity.
New company's.
In 1863 a new railway company was found to full the wishes of the citizens. It was called the ‘Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen or SS for short. This company wasn’t found by the government but by a private group of investors who received a license for the railways built by the State. 
The other companies just continued with building railroad tracks. There even more Railway companies found. The Noord-Brabants-duitse Spoorweg-Maatschappij or NBDS
S for short. It was found to finish the railway track that connected Saint Petersburg, Berlin and London.
1890-1938.
The fusion.
In 1890 all the railway companies were fused together and split into 2 companies. The HSM and the SS. The railways were reclassified and based on the English models. This was necessary because for people of the Netherlands, travelling by train wasn’t very handy due to all those companies who had their own rules and trains.
Workers on strike.
In 1903 the labor of the railway companies weren’t happy with their work because, the condition in which they had to work was very bad. They had a low wage for the hard work they had to do. In 1903 were the workers very angry so they went on strike. And it worked because the bosses of the companies couldn’t do without them so the conditions were improved etc. When the first world war began in 1914 the Netherlands stayed neutral. The train transportation was now partly used for militaries. The railways were a part of the war because it was easy to transport. Due this war the HSM and the SS had to work together and even after the war they became closer. This has led to a fusion in 1937 The ‘Nederlandse Spoorwegen’ or NS was found.
Evolution of train stations.
Today.
In total there are 404 railway stations in the Netherlands. 381 stations are managed by the NS. Some of them are really old looking and some of them are more by the time. There are also really ugly stations like Eindhoven CS. Today the day the stations have become much more evolved.
In the past.
In the past you only had those yellow boards where you could look for the trains. You couldn’t for example look on the internet. There were no for example escalators, which now can’t be thought of gone. An really old station for example is Zandvoort. A rather new one is Utrecht CS. By Zandvoort you can really see the old architecture.
Type of trains.
There have been a lot of different trains. It evolved from steam trains into diesel trains and into electric trains. 
The first train was called the Arend and it drove from Amsterdam to haarlem. Then a lot of different steam trains came who were all called series + a number, so like series 600. 
After a lot of development a new kind of train was invented who went on diesel. It was much cheaper and easier to use. Currently the only diesel trains that are still been used are called: The buffel. The lines they are still used on are: Zwolle – Enschede, Zwolle – Kampen, and Apeldoorn – Zutphen. 
Today the day we mainly see electric trains driving. They are noticeable by the big electricity masts above them which give them power. Trains are usually divided into two classes: the first and the second. 
In the past there also was a third class but they thought that was not useable. Almost all the trains have now a day's free Wi-Fi wireless connection so you can go on the internet.In the past you had to buy a ticket to take the train, nowadays you can use your OV chipkaart. 
types of trains in the Netherlands.
• Sprinter, are fast trains who don’t have many stops.
• The Thalys is a new super-fast train which can have speeds from up to 300km/h.
• Intercity, is also a fast train who goes from a city to another city without stops.

"Youth of the Nation" is the second single off American Christian nu metal band P.O.D.'s fourth studio album "Satellite". The song was released on December 25, 2001.
The song was inspired partially by the Santana High School and Columbine High School shootings. In a 2008 interview, guitarist Marcos Curiel described it:
"We were rehearsing and writing Satellite a couple of blocks away from the school. One day on the way to the studio, there were all these helicopters and cars speeding by. We really didn’t know what was going on. When we got to the studio, this guy had the news on, and he was like, ‘This kid just went and started blasting fools.’ So we started jamming, and that rhythm just naturally came out then Wuv [Bernardo, drummer] put that drumbeat on it, and the song was born."

Luis of Spain, Count of Chinchón

Infante Luis Antonio Jaime of Spain (25 July 1727 – 7 August 1785) and was known as the Cardinal-Infante. He was also then last child of Philip V of Spain and his wife Elisabeth Farnese. He is famous for being the youngest Cardinal in history. He also had close ties with several famous Spanish painters of his day including Francisco de Goya. 
Brief biography.
Luis was born in the city of Seville in Spain. He was the youngest child of the king King and queen of Spain. He was given the name Luis in honour of his French great-grandfather Louis XIV. From a young age his father showered various religious titles upon his youngest son, even creating him a Primate of Spain. Giving him the rank of an Archbishop while barely eight years old. He was also an Infante of Spain by birth being the child of a reigning Spanish monarch giving him the use of "Royal Highness" from birth. Despite his parents decisions the young Luis abandoned his religious rank due to a lack of interest in his charges on 18 December 1754. He was given the title of Count of Chinchón by which he is known. The title was eventually inherited by his daughter Maria Teresa and was given to him by his older brother The Infante Felipe.
Following the death of his childless elder half-brother King Fernando VI in 1759 he claimed the throne and his brother Carlos (the future Charles III of Spain claimed the throne for himself exiling his younger brother from the royal court in Madrid. 
Marriage.
In his exile Luis contracted a marriage with María Teresa de Vallabriga herself an aristocrat but not royalty. 
As he now had children he could also claim the throne of the Two Sicilies but his brother Charles III barred his right and made sure he and his family were never allowed at court. He died aged 58 having never reconciled with his elder brother. His title was inherited by his eldest daughter whose children then inherited the title too.

Pentre Ifan

The Pentre Ifan dolmen is the largest and best preserved neolithic dolmen in Wales. It is on the ancient manor of Pentre Ifan in the civil parish of Nevern, Pembrokeshire, Wales. The manor was the home of the Bowen family going back to the 11th century.
History.
The dolmen dates from about 3,500 B.C. It may have been used for group burials. The existing stones form the door, called a portal and main chamber of the tomb. These would have been covered with a large stone mound about 36.6 m long and 17 m wide. Some of the stones have been scattered, but at least seven are in their original position. The capstone is 5.1 m in length, and is thought to to weigh 16 tonnes, and rises 2.4 m above the ground. It is held up by the narrow tips of three uprights. These stones make a chamber that is 3 m long, 2 m wide and 3 m high. A large stone has been used to block the entrance.
The facade around the portal is a carefully built dry stone wall.
William Francis Grimes carried out archaeological diggings at the site in 1936/1937 and 1958/1959. Small pieces of flint and pottery were discovered during these digs. This are also signs that there may have been holes dug for some sort of ritual purpose long before the dolmen was set up.
The dolmen is owned and looked after by Cadw, the Welsh Historic Monuments Agency. The site is well-kept and entrance is free. It is about 17 km from Cardigan. It has views down the Nevern Valley to the sea.

Pembrokeshire Coast Path

Pembrokeshire Coast Path (Welsh: "Llwybr Arfordir Sir Benfro" 
 
) (also called the Pembrokeshire Coastal Path) is a National Trail in Pembrokeshire in the Wales, in the United Kingdom. It is a footpath that anyone can walk anytime for free. It was made a footpath in 1970. It is 186 mi long. The highest place on the path is Pen yr afr. It is 175 m high. It's lowest place is Sandy Haven crossing. It is 6 ft low at the water. The path goes along coast and people walking on the path will see the water most of the time. 
The path starts at Amroth and goes north to Poppit Sands. A plaque is located at Poppit Sands. The path used to stop, or start, at Poppit Sands. Now it goes to St. Dogmaels. At St. Dogmaels the path connects to another path called the Ceredigion Coast Path. The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is a part of the Wales Coast Path.
History.
The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park was founded in 1952. After it was founded, Ronald Lockley did a survey for a path on the coastline. The region was very rural. There were villages on the coastline but communication between other villages was very hard. People often used boats to visit each other. Lockey reported on this in 1953. He suggested that a footpath be created to help. Most of the places the path would go through were public space, so anyone could walk on them without any problems. Other parts were owned by people, so you could not walk on the path without asking. They asked the owners if it was okay to use their land for the paths and most people said it as ok. There are still some areas of the path that go in strange directions because path users cannot walk on the private land. It took 17 years to build the path. 100 footbridges and 479 stiles were built. Thousands of stairs were built into the ground.
The path was opened on May 16, 1970 by Wynford Vaughan-Thomas. It was 180 mi long. Now it is 186 mi.
Description.
Most of the path is located in Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. The path goes along the Irish Sea. There are many different types of geological and environmental areas. There are headlands, cliffs, coves, glacial valleys, and more. The path goes by 58 beaches and 14 harbors.
Most of the path is easy to walk. There is one part that goes 35,000 ft high. There are two areas near the water that it passes which sometimes get flooded. These parts are at Dale and Sandy Haven. The path goes through some towns and villages. These include Tenby, St Davids, Solva and Newport. 
Connected trails.
There are some trails that connect to the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. They are:
Geology.
The rocks under the path are over 300 million years old. The look of the land that the path goes along is the effect of the Ice Age. There are a variety of different types of rocks one can see on the path: igneous, pre-Cambrian, and more.
Wildlife.
Walkers on the path can see wild flowers during the seasons of Spring and Summer. There are a lot of birds. Many of the birds are seabirds. There are also porpoises, dolphins, and seals in the water off the path.
Ancient history.
There are historical sites on the path that date back to Neolithic times. There are places where there used to be hut circles. There are former places that people lived in during the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Most of the land near the path is farmed and people also fish off the path like they did in ancient times, but with modern tools.
Awards.
The path was named the second best "National Geographic's" place to visit on a coast in 2011. The beaches along the path are famous also and have won over 300 awards for their quality, environmentalism and beauty.

Hysteresis

Not to be confused with Hysteria.
Hysteresis is a concept in physical science.
In hysteresis the output of a system depends not only on its input, but also on its history of past inputs. This is because the history affects the value of an internal state. To predict the future outputs of a system, either its internal state or its history must be known. 
The effect may happen because of a lag between input and output. This effect disappears as the input changes more slowly. This effect meets the description of hysteresis given above, but is often referred to as "rate-dependent hysteresis" to distinguish it from hysteresis with a more durable memory effect.
Hysteresis occurs in ferromagnetic materials and ferroelectric materials. It also occurs in the deformation of some materials (such as rubber bands and shape-memory alloys). Many artificial systems are designed to have hysteresis: for example, in thermostats and computers.

The Anglesey Coastal Path is a 1400 mi is a footpath on the island of Anglesey, Wales in the United Kingdom. The footpath is a part of the Wales Coast Path. 
Description.
The footpath follows the coast of the island of Anglesey. It goes around the entire island except in two places. Those two places are Plas Newydd and Afon Alaw between Llanfachraeth and Llanynghenedl. The path starts at Holyhead. It travels through an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The majority of the path travels through public land with a small amount going through private land. Owners of the private land have given permission for walkers to pass through their property. The path is part of the All Wales Coast Path.
The path cost £1.4 million to build. It was built by two organizations: Menter Môn and Isle of Anglesey County Council. It was opened on June 9, 2006 by Rhodri Morgan.

This definition is accepted by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). The FAI is an international standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics. The line is named after Theodore von Kármán (1881–1963), a Hungarian-American engineer and physicist. He was active in aeronautics and astronautics. He was the first to calculate that around this altitude, the atmosphere becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight. An aircraft at this altitude would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to obtain enough lift to support itself. There is a sudden increase in temperature of the atmosphere and solar radiation just below the line. This places the line within the greater thermosphere.

Battle of Hampton Roads

The Battle of Hampton Roads was a naval battle of the American Civil War. It was fought on March 8 and 9, 1862 near Hampton Roads, Virginia. It was an important battle because it was the first combat between ironclad warships.
The Confederate ironclad "CSS Virginia" tried to break the Union navy blockade of Hampton Roads. The blockade prevented all commerce with Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia. On March 8, the "Virginia" sank and damaged several union battleships. On March 8, the Union ironclad USS "Monitor" arrived and fought the "Virginia". The battle lasted for several hours. But neither ship could defeat the other. Both ships left the fight thinking they had won. But the Confederates failed to break the blockade. Within a year both ironclads were lost. When Norfolk fell, the CSS "Virginia" was destroyed by its crew so it wouldn't be captured. The USS "Monitor" was lost in a storm near Cape Hatteras.

Dumb Starbucks

Dumb Starbucks was a coffee shop opened by comedian Nathan Fielder. It was closed after three days because it did not have a proper health license. Because the shop was a parody making fun of the real Starbucks company, Fielder was able to use their logo.
Items and Beverages.
In a normal Starbucks store, you will usually see a board with the beverages that you can purchase. But in Dumb Starbucks, it had the word "Dumb" in front of the name of the beverage you would see at Starbucks. For example, if you saw the Vanilla Latte at Starbucks, in Dumb Starbucks, it would be called "Dumb Vanilla Latte". Usually Starbucks has some music CDs, but Dumb Starbucks also took the same music Cd's and wrote the word " Dumb" in front of them.
Plans.
Nathan Fielder had planned to open another Dumb Starbucks in Brooklyn, New York, but he didn't try to open one, even with health documents. Many people have did not like Fielder and his new parody. Some people felt he was making fun of them being Starbucks customers, others said his coffee was just terrible.

George Eliot (spy)

George Eliot was an English spy during the rule of Queen Elizabeth I.
George Eliot is reported to have been a very bad person. He earned his living as a con artist (someone who gains the trust of another and then robs them). He was well known as a rapist and suspected of being a murderer. Eliot became a spy for Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. This was to avoid a charge from the last crime he committed. Eliot agreed to seek out Catholics who did not attend Mass or conform to the rules of the state. He would then hand them over to the authorities for punishment.
At Lyford Grange in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), he tracked down the Jesuit priest, Edmund Campion. Eliot called for a magistrate from Abingdon. He arrested Campion and had him sent to London for trial and execution.

Thermostat

A thermostat is a sensor which keeps a heating system near to a desired temperature or setpoint. It is a control system.
The thermostat works by switching heating or cooling devices on or off. This is what happens in a central heating system or an air conditioner. In some systems it works by switching a 'heat transfer fluid' off or on as needed to keep the set temperature. The name is derived from the Greek words "thermos" "hot" and "statos" "a standing".
The simplest kind of thermostat is a bimetal strip which bends as the temperature rises, and at a set point breaks the circuit of an electrical current. Kitchen toasters use this kind of thermostat.
Because they control a system, thermostats are examples of feedback devices which maintain a steady local environment against temperature changes outside the outside world. In cybernetics, the thermostat is an example of a machine which uses feedback to maintain the stability of a heating system.

Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn

Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn (c. 1362 – 30 September 1440), was a powerful Welsh marcher lord. He became Baron after his father's death in July 1388. His main military actions were against the Welsh, during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr. 
Reginald de Grey was responsible for giving out royal demands in the Northern March. This included calling the local nobility and gentry and their men to Royal and military service. He was had been in a long-running legal argument with Glyndŵr, claiming part of Glyndwr's land as his own. Under King Richard II the case had been found in favour of Glyndŵr. When Henry IV became king, Grey took over the land. 
Welsh rebellion.
Glyndŵr tried to take legal action in 1400, but the court told him to give the land to Grey. Grey also did not tell Glyndŵr that his men were needed service in Scotland until the last moment. This made it impossible for Glyndŵr to send the men or even send an explanation for not sending them. Refusing or failing to follow an order of the King was treason. Glyndŵr's lands were would be taken until he could prove he was loyal to the king or receive punishment. On 16 September Glyndŵr and his brothers burned Grey's property. For three days his Welsh forces attacked the countryside of Flintshire and Denbighshire. On 24 September, Glyndwr's forces were defeated at Welshpool.
De Grey asked Glyndŵr to a meeting, but arrived with a large force, and attempted to capture Glyndŵr. Glyndŵr escaped and went into hiding, becoming a traitor in English eyes. King Henry took the land of Glyndŵr's friends, and gave them to John Beaufort, his half-brother. The rebellion spread across Wales by 1402. Lord Grey was taken prisoner by Glyndŵr's forces in an ambush near Ruthin in January. 
A ransom of 10,000 marks was asked for him. Lord Grey was was made to promise not to fight against Glyndŵr again. King Henry IV sent 11 knights to meet with Glyndŵr. They paid the money to release Grey. Lord Grey and his family would have been expected to repay the money. 
The Grey family sold the Ruthin Lordship to King Henry VII in 1508 when the family needed money. 
Hundred Years' War.
Grey was a member of the Council which governed England during the absence of Henry V in France in 1415. He later fought against the French in the Hundred Years' War in 1420 and 1421. He also served as Governor of Ireland.

An ORCID is a code to identify someone who writes academic articles. ORCID stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID. Each person can have their own ORCID. ORCIDs make it easy to know which articles someone has written, even if they change their name. They also helps tell who has written which articles, if there is more than one writer with the same name. ORCID was started on 16 October 2012.
ORCIDs usually have four groups of four numbers. An example of a person with an ORCID is John Wilbanks. His ORCID is http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385. That is also the web address of the page about him, on the ORCID website. His ORCID can also be written as "ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385". Sometimes an ORCID has an "X" instead of a number at the end. An example of this is Nick Jennings's ORCID. His is http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X. The final number (or "X") is a check digit.

1900 Galveston Hurricane

The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 hit the city of Galveston, Texas on September 8, 1900. This hurricane was very large, and it is the deadliest hurricane in the history of the United States. It killed between 8,000 to 12,000 people. It was a "Category 4 hurricane" on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. 
Prelude to the great storm.
The U.S. National Weather Service was very simple in 1900. They did not have good information on what the storm was doing. As a result they could not give people advance warnings. Galveston was located on a sandbar island off the coast of Texas. It was only about nine feet above sea level. The population was about 38,000. On the morning of 8 September 1900, nobody knew that 8,000 of that number would be gone by the next day.
The hurricane.
The Galveston hurricane began developing about August 30, 1900 in the middle Atlantic Ocean. It was still a tropical storm when it moved to Cuba on September 4. It hit Key West on September 6. At that point it became a full hurricane. It was a Category 4 hurricane when it got near the Texas coast. In the early afternoon of September 8 it hit with little warning. By the next morning it was gone and so was much of Galveston. After that, it moved back east as a tropical storm over the U.S. The damage was over $30,000,000. Galveston began rebuilding almost right away. A new seawall was built and many buildings were raised several feet. But it could not recover completely. The storm convinced most in the shipping industry to move to Houston with its safer harbor. Galveston would never again be the busiest shipping port in Texas.

Timer

A timer is a kind of clock for measuring time intervals. A timer which counts upwards from zero for measuring time is often called a "stopwatch". A device which counts down from a specified time interval is more usually called a "timer". A simple example is an hourglass. Some timers sound an audible alarm that the time is up. Time switches, timing mechanisms which activate a switch, are sometimes called "timers".

Independence (statistics)

Probability theory talks about events which occur with a given (possibly unknown) probability. Usually, when it talks about several events occurring, it assumes that if one event occurs, this does not change the probablility of the other events occurring. Abraham de Moivre wrote: "Two Events are independent, when they have no connexion one with the other, and that the happening of one neither forwards nor obstructs the happening of the other."

The South Asian river dolphin ("Platanista gangetica") is a freshwater or river dolphin found in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan.
It is split into two subspecies, the Ganges river dolphin ("P. g. gangetica") and Indus river dolphin ("P. g. minor"). 
From the 1970s until 1998, they were regarded as separate species; however, in 1998, their classification was changed from two separate species to subspecies of a single species. The idea was to wait until genetic analysis had decided how best to classify them.

The Viverravidae are an extinct family of early mammalian carnivores. They are in the superfamily Miacoidea, and lived from the early Palaeocene to the Eocene. They first appeared in the Paleocene of North America about 60 million years ago.
Viverravidae is a monophyletic family. In viverravids, the number of molars is reduced to two and the skull is long. 
They are probably not related to any living carnivorans. The viverravids were previously thought to be the earliest carnivorans. A recent study of their skull morphology puts them outside the order Carnivora.

An Assisted living residence is a popular housing alternative to a nursing home for senior citizens. These homes give help or supervision with daily living activities. They also allow services by outside health care providers. They check residents and resident activities to make sure health, safety and well being are maintained. Assistance may include the giving or supervision of medicine or personal care services. "The philosophy of assisted living is to treat all residents with dignity; to give privacy and to encourage independence." The gradual shift to assisted living began between 1979 and 1985 in the United States.

Bardsey Island

Bardsey Island (Welsh: "Ynys Enlli" 
 
), is a small island 1.9 mi off the coast of Wales. Bardsey is 0.6 mi wide, 1.0 mi long and 179 ha in area. The north east rises steeply from the sea to a height of 548 ft at "Mynydd Enlli." The western end is low and flat farmland. On the south, the island narrows to a peninsula with a lighthouse. It is the fourth largest island in Wales.
Bardsey has several names, including the "Island of 20,000 saints". In Welsh the name means "The Island in the Currents". In English name means the "Island of the Bards", or possibly the "Island of Barda", a Viking chieftain
The island has been an important religious site. In 516 Saint Cadfan built a monastery on Bardsey. In medieval times many pilgrims visited the island, and by 1212 the monastery was part of the Augustinian Canons Regular. In 1537 Henry VIII closed the monastery and had the buildings pulled down, but pilgrims still visit the island.
Bardsey Island is famous for its wildlife and rugged scenery. A bird observatory was set up in 1953 as the island is on important migration routes. It is a nesting place for Manx shearwaters and choughs. It also has rare plants, and habitats undisturbed by modern farming practices. It is a good place to see grey seals, dolphins and porpoises.
The spirituality and sacredness of the island, its relative remoteness, and its legendary claim to be the burial site of King Arthur, have given it a special place in the cultural life of Wales. It has attracted artists, writers and musicians to its shores. It has inspired award winning literature.
Geology.
The island is formed from rocks of the late Precambrian Gwna Group, part of the Monian Supergroup. The rocks are a mélange, often called Gwna Mélange, which have an unusual mix of clasts of all sizes up to 100m across. These are also very varied types, including both sedimentary and igneous rocks. Blocks of sheared granite in the melange can be seen in the northwestern coastal cliffs of the island. In other places there are clasts of quartzite, limestone, sandstone, mudstone, jasper and basalt. The deposit is an olistostrome, a very large underwater landslide possibly caused by an earthquake some time after 614 million years ago.
A dolerite dyke of Ordovician age can be seen in the melange at Trwyn y Gorlech in the north. There is an olivine dolerite dyke of Tertiary age at Cafn Enlli in the southeast. Further dykes can be seen in the cliffs at Ogof y Gaseg and at Ogof Hir.
A thin spread of glacial till stretches across the centre of the island. This was left behind by the Devensian Irish Sea Icesheet. There is a small patch of blown sand at Porth Solfach on the west coast and a landslip at Briw Cerrig at the foot of the cliffs on the east coast.
History.
People lived on the island in Neolithic times, and traces of their hut circles remain. During the 5th century the island became a place of refuge for Christians and a small Celtic monastery existed. In 516 Saint Cadfan arrived from Brittany and directed the building of St Mary's Abbey. In medieval times three pilgrimages to Bardsey Island were said to be equal to one visit to Rome. In 1188 the abbey was still a Celtic institution, but by 1212 it belonged to the Augustinians. Many people still walk to Aberdaron and Uwchmynydd each year in the footsteps of the saints. Only ruins of the old abbey's 13th-century bell tower remain. A Celtic cross in the ruins commemorates the 20,000 saints claimed to be buried on the island.
Saint Deiniol, the bishop of Bangor, was buried on the island in 584. Saint Dyfrig was also buried on Bardsey Island, although in 1120 his remains were moved to Llandaff.
The "Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act" of 1536, on the orders of Henry VIII, resulted in "St Mary's Abbey" being closed and its buildings pulled down in 1537. The choir stalls, two screens and the bells were moved to Llanengan, where the parish church was then being built.
For many years Bardsey Island formed part of the Newborough Estate. Between 1870 and 1875 the island's farms were rebuilt. A small limestone quarry was opened, and a lime kiln set up. "Carreg" and "Plas Bach" are separate buildings, but the remaining eight were built as semi-detached houses, each pair with outbuildings set around a shared yard. The buildings are Grade II listed. In 2008, Cadw gave £15,000 to help with some repairs. Only one of the original "croglofft" cottages, "Carreg Bach", is still standing. Given the choice of a harbour or a new church, in 1875 the islanders asked for a place of worship; a Methodist chapel was built.
The island had a population of 132 in 1881; by 1961 it had fallen to 17. The island's small school, opened in a former chapel in 1919, closed in 1953. By 2003 the population was down to 4.
"Bardsey Island Trust (Welsh: "Ymddiriedolaeth Ynys Enlli" 
 
)" bought the island in 1979. It was given money by the Church in Wales and many Welsh academics and public figures. The trust gets its money from membership subscriptions, grants and donations. It wants to protect the wildlife, buildings and archaeological sites of the island. It also promotes its artistic and cultural life, and wants people to visit as a place of natural beauty and pilgrimage. In 2000, the trust advertised for for someone to run the 440 acre sheep farm on the island. They had 1,100 applications. The farm is now run by the "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds"; and the land is managed to keep the natural habitat. Oats, turnips and swedes are grown; goats, ducks, geese and chickens kept; and there is a mixed flock of sheep and Welsh black cattle.
Bardsey apple.
An old and twisted apple tree was found growing by the side of "Plas Bach." It is believed to be all that is left of an orchard planted by the monks who lived there a thousand years ago. In 1998, experts on British apples said this tree was the only example of the "Bardsey Apple (Welsh: "Afal Enlli" 
 
)". The tree has been propagated by grafting and is available commercially.
Bardsey Lighthouse.
Bardsey Lighthouse stands on the south end of the island and guides vessels passing through St George's Channel and the Irish Sea. It is the only square lighthouse looked after by Trinity House.
Lt. Thomas Evans R.N., asked for a light on the island in 1816. In 1821 Trinity House built the lighthouse at a cost of £5,470 12s 6d with another £2,950 16s 7d for the lantern.
Joseph Nelson was the engineer and builder. He had served under Daniel Alexander, a Trinity House architect, whose influence can be seen on parts of the design including the heavy weathered string-course near the base and the blocked and hooded directional-light window. Joseph Nelson is linked to the design of at least 15 lighthouses, mostly in the Bristol Channel.
The Lighthouse is built of ashlar limestone and is not plastered. It is painted in red and white bands on the outside. The Lighthouse tower is 30 m (98 ft) high and is unusual because it is square, not round. Unlike many other lighthouses, it has kept its original gallery railings, which are of iron and bellied (i.e. curved out in width at their crowns) towards the top. The present lantern, fitted in 1856, did not need the original railings to be taken down.
The walls are 1.2 m (4 ft) thick at the base and 0.9 m (3 ft) at the top.
At first, the light had reflectors but changed to a dioptric (refracting) mechanism in 1838. The present lantern of 1856 is a 4.27 m (14 ft) wide chamfered octagon and the light is fixed, instead of revolving. The present revolving apparatus was put in place in 1873. It gives a group of five flashes, at first with an oil-lamp, but changed to electric in 1973.
The Lighthouse is unusual in lacking any sort of harbour. As it is on an established migratory route, the tower has many bird casualties. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and Trinity House have tried to help the problem by providing perches on the lantern top and flood-lighting the tower, but this does not seem to have helped.
In 1987 the Lighthouse was changed to automatic operation, and is now checked by the Trinity House Depot at Harwich. A local person does regular maintenance.
"Y Storws", also known as "The Boathouse", was built a few years before the lighthouse, near the landing place at "Y Cafn".
Wildlife.
The island was made a "National Nature Reserve" in 1986, and is part of "Glannau Aberdaron ac Ynys Enlli Special Protection Area (Welsh: "Ardal Gwarchodaeth Arbennig Glannau Aberdaron ac Ynys Enlli" 
 
)". It is now a favourite bird-watching location, on the migration routes of thousands of birds. "Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory" (Welsh: "Gwylfa Maes ac Adar Ynys Enlli" 
 
), founded in 1953, nets and rings 8,000 birds each year to study their migration patterns.
The island was made a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of its maritime life. This includes internationally rare lichens; bryophyte, plants, bird species; and intertidal communities. Nationally important flowering plants include sharp rush, rock sea lavender, small adder's tongue, western clover, and the rare purple loosestrife. Two nationally rare heathland lichens are found on the slopes of "Mynydd Enlli": the ciliate strap lichen and golden hair lichen; and there are over 350 lichen species in total. The leafcutter bee, which cuts neat, rounded circles in rose leaves, used to seal the entrance to its nest, is native.
Thousands of birds pass through each year on their way to their breeding or wintering grounds. Chiffchaffs, goldcrests and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, whitethroats and spotted flycatchers.
About 30 species of bird regularly nest on the island, including ravens, little owls, oystercatchers and the rare chough. Hundreds of sea birds, including razorbills, guillemots, fulmars and kittiwakes, spend the summer nesting on the island's eastern cliffs. There are no land predators such as rats or foxes on the island. On a dark moonless night an eerie cackling can be heard across the island as 7,000 pairs of Manx shearwaters, 3.5 per cent of the British population, come ashore to lay and incubate their eggs in abandoned rabbit warrens or newly dug burrows.
The island is one of the best places in Gwynedd to see grey seals. In mid summer over 200 can be seen, lying in the sun on the rocks or swimming in the sea. About 15 pups are born each autumn. Their sharp teeth and strong jaws are perfect for breaking the shells of lobsters and crabs which live in the waters. It is also possible to see bottlenose and Risso's dolphins, and porpoises. The currents around the island carry food-rich water. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been carrying out surveys since 1999 to find out which areas are important for feeding and nursing calves.
The seas around the island are rich in marine life. There are forests of strap seaweed; in the rock pools are sea anemones, crabs and small fish; and in deeper waters, the rocks are covered by sponges and sea squirts. The yellow star anemone, found offshore, is more common to the Mediterranean.
Culture.
It was tradition for the island to elect the "King of Bardsey"" (Welsh:Brenin Enlli"). From 1826 he was crowned by Baron Newborough or his representative. The crown is now kept at Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool, although calls have been made for it to return to Gwynedd. The first known King was John Williams. His son, John Williams II, the third of the recorded kings, was deposed in 1900, and asked to leave the island as he had become an alcoholic. At the start of World War I, the last king, Love Pritchard, offered himself and the men of Bardsey Island for military service. He was refused as he was considered too old at the age of 71. Pritchard was angry and declared the island a neutral power. In 1925 Pritchard left the island for the mainland, to seek an easier way of life, but died the following year.
Yorkshire born poet Christine Evans lives half the year on Bardsey Island, spending the winters at Uwchmynydd. She moved to Pwllheli as a teacher, and married into a Bardsey Island farming family. While on maternity leave in 1976, she started writing poems, and her first book was published seven years later. "Cometary Phrases" was "Welsh Book of the Year 1989" and she was the winner of the first "Roland Mathias Prize" in 2005.
Edgar Ewart Pritchard, an amateur movie-maker from Brownhills, produced "The Island in the Current", a colour movie of life on Bardsey Island, in 1953. A copy is held by the "National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales".
Opera singer Bryn Terfel, a patron of the Bardsey Island Trust, has performed in the island's chapel. Llio Rhydderch recorded "Enlli "in 2002, an album inspired by the spiritual feelings from a pilgrimage.
Dilys Cadwaladr, the former school teacher on the island, in 1953 became the first woman to win the "Crown" at the National Eisteddfod, for her long poem "Y Llen". Artist Brenda Chamberlain won the "Gold Medal for Art" at the Eisteddfod on two occasions: in 1951 for "Girl with Siamese Cat", and in 1953 with "The Christin Children". Some of the murals she painted can still be seen on the walls of "Carreg", where she lived from 1947 to 1962. Wildlife artist Kim Atkinson, whose work has been widely shown in Wales and England, lived on the island as a child, and came back to live there in the 1980s.
Since 1999," "Bardsey Island Trust has had an Artist in Residence who spends several weeks on the island producing work which is later shown on the mainland. A Welsh literary residence was created in 2002; singer-songwriter Fflur Dafydd spent six weeks working on a collection of poetry and prose. Her play "Hugo" was inspired by her stay, and she has produced two novels, "Atyniad (English: "Attraction" 
 
)", which won the prose medal at the 2006 Eisteddfod; and "Twenty Thousand Saints", winner of the "Oxfam Hay Prize", which tells how the women of the island, starved of men, turn to each other.
In 2009 Cowbois Rhos Botwnnog became the first electric rock group to play on the island, as part of S4C's "Bandit" series.
Transport.
There is a ferry services to Bardsey Island from "Porth Meudwy" and Pwllheli.
At times, the wind and the fierce sea currents make sailing between the island and the mainland impossible. Sometimes boats are unable to reach or leave Bardsey Island for weeks. In 2000, 17 visitors had to stay for two weeks when strong winds prevented a boats from reaching the island.

Bryn Celli Ddu

Bryn Celli Ddu is a prehistoric site on the Welsh island of Anglesey near Llanddaniel Fab. Its name means 'the mound in the dark grove'. It was robbed in 1699 and archaeologically dug between 1928 and 1929.
During the Neolithic period a stone circle and henge stood at the site. There were 14 stones in the circle, and the henge was about 30 m in diameter, with a ditch about 5 m across. The ditch was about 2 m deep. There was probably a path or causeway across the ditch to the henge. A small human bone from the ear, covered with a flat stone, was found in an area of burnt material in the centre. The amount of silt in the ditch showed that it had been used for a long time.
The stone circle was pulled down in the early Bronze Age. Five of the stones were removed, two were pushed over, and six were smashed, and one was buried.
A passage grave was built in the centre of the henge. The passage is about 8.5m long and 1 m wide. The burial chamber is about 2 m wide, made from six large upright stones, covered with two capstones. A stone, carved with a twisting, serpent like design was in the burial chamber. It has been moved to the National Museum of Wales and replaced with a copy standing outside. The earth barrow covering the grave was made in after the 1928 dig; the original was probably much bigger.
In 1906 Norman Lockyer said that Bryn Celli Ddu marked the summer solstice. This was made fun of at the time, but research by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas in 1997- 98 showed it was true. They also say the site can be used as an agricultural calendar. Steve Burrow, curator of Neolithic archaeology at Amgueddfa Cymru (National Museum of Wales), has more recently supported the case for summer solstice alignment. This alignment links Bryn Celli Ddu to other sites, including Maes Howe and Newgrange, both of which point to the Winter solstice. It has also been suggested that a feature similar to the 'lightbox' at Newgrange may be matched at Bryn Celli Ddu (Pitts, 2006).
A row of five postholes which were thought to have been dug at the same time as the tomb, about 3000 BC, are now known to be much earlier. Early results from radiocarbon tests show that pine charcoal from two of the pits goes back to the Mesolithic (Pitts, 2006).
Two researchers, Rupert Soskin and Michael Bott recently suggested that the pillar standing within the chamber is in fact the petrified remains of a tree trunk. Study of the pillar shows that it looks like the bark of a tree, however what is unknown at the moment, is whether the pillar is indeed petrified wood or natural rock chosen by the tomb builders because of its unusual appearance.

iOS 8 is the eighth major version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 2, 2014. It contains several new features, such as an app named Health, and a framework called HealthKit. 
Siri is able to be activated hands-free when it is plugged into power and can also tell users what song is playing using Shazam integration.
The Golden Master of iOS 8 was released to developers on September 9, 2014, and the final release of iOS 8 was released to the public on September 17, 2014.
New features.
Photos and Camera.
The Photos app now has more options to edit the user's pictures. The cropping feature now allows the user to turn the image clockwise and counter-clockwise. The user can also set the brightness and colors you want for the user's pictures. The Camera app now has a shot timer that can be set for 3 or 10 seconds.
Messages.
Users can send audio and video messages by holding down the record button.
Design.
The design of iOS 8 is the same as iOS 7 or iOS 7.1. There are some small changes such as added transparency and faster animation effects. The multitasking screen now shows a list of contacts that the user has talked with recently, as well as the user's favorite contacts.
Keyboards.
iOS 8 also includes a new predictive typing feature called QuickType. It displays word selections above the keyboard as the user types. The feature can be turned off in Settings, or hidden using a swipe gesture. In addition, iOS 8 will allow users to install third-party keyboards. 
Family Sharing.
In iOS 8, a user can add six other people as family members. Family members can share purchased apps, music, and books using the same credit card. iOS 8 can also set up photo streams for every family member. The calendar can also sync between all family members. 
iCloud Drive.
iCloud Drive allows users to save photos, videos, documents, music, and other data on iCloud. A user can start their work on one device and continue their work on another device. Users will get 5 GB of storage for free, but they can buy more storage.
HealthKit.
HealthKit is a service that allows developers to make software that will be included in the new Health app. This app tracks user's steps, oxygen, sleep and other data. Users can also make an emergency card to help them in case of an emergency. HealthKit is only on iOS 8.4 or later/Higher.

Wi-Fi Calling.
In iOS 8, Apple integrated Wi-Fi calling. This service allows mobile phone calls over Wi-Fi. It is planned to be available for customers of T-Mobile in the US.Apple developers have removed many errors in IOS 8 Beta 5 like Wi-Fi sync but many other problems are still there
Problems.
A study by Crittercism found that the rate at which applications crashed in their tests was 3.56% on iOS 8, higher than the 2% found on iOS 7.1.
Although the update is officially available for the iPhone 4S, it is recommended that users of the iPhone 4S do not upgrade, due to problems such as the battery draining quickly and the phone hanging up whenever a user makes a call.
On September 24, 2014, the iOS 8.0.1 release caused problems for iPhone 6 devices by turning off Touch ID and not allowing the phone to make calls. The update was released at 12:00 PM EST, and at around 2:00 PM EST, Apple removed the update due to these problems, as well as other small problems. A day later, Apple released iOS 8.0.2 which has all the fixes included with iOS 8.0.1 and also fixes the problems that iOS 8.0.1 brought.

9th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment

The 9th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
History.
Shortly after the Battle of Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers. They were to serve for three months. The state of Illinois put out a call to form units. Six companies came from St. Clair County. Madison County sent three companies. Montgomery county sent one company. All nine companies met at Springfield, Illinois on 23 April 1861. There they were formed into the 9th Regiment, Illinois volunteer infantry. There were rumors that the Confederates intended to invade at Cairo, Illinois. In response, orders were issued for the 9th Infantry to occupy Cairo. They arrived and set up camp on 1 May 1861.
The first few months were spent on the Mississippi river guarding Cairo. Their three month enlistments were up in July. Most of the men reenlisted for three years. In September the regiment moved to Paducah, Kentucky. There they did little more than drill practice. On 15 February 1862 they joined the fighting at the Battle of Fort Donelson. Their losses included 36 killed and 165 wounded, out of a total strength of 600. After the Confederates surrendered, they were transported by riverboats up the Tennessee River. They left the boats at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee and camped nearby. On 6 April 1862 they woke up to the sound of cannons. While they were waiting to join the battle, new orders were given. They were ordered to exchange their gray coats for Union blue. This way they would not be mistaken for Confederate troops. They then joined the battle of Shiloh. They fought most of the day. At Shiloh the 9th Illinois had the highest casualties of any Illinois unit. They lost 366 of their comrades They also fought at the Second Battle of Corinth. The regiment was changed to the 9th Illinois Volunteer Mounted Infantry Regiment on March 15, 1863. On 9 July 1865 the 9th Illinois Infantry was mustered out (released from military service) at Louisville, Kentucky.
Total strength and casualties.
The regiment suffered 5 officers and 211 recruited men killed in action or mortally wounded. 1 officer and 200 enlisted men died of disease. In total there were 417 casualties (persons killed or wounded).
Uniforms.
The 9th Illinois volunteers, along with the 8th, 11th, and 12th, all wore gray coats trimmed in blue. They also wore Zouave caps. In 1862, they were fitted with the standard Union blue uniforms. Most of the Illinois infantry regiments were issued the Springfield Model 1861 muskets.

Clinometer

A clinometer is an instrument that is used for measuring the angle or elevation of slopes. The name "clinometer" comes from Greek and English words. "Klinein" (Greek) means to slope. "Meter" (English) means measurement.
A simple way to create a clinometer is to tape a a straw to the bottom of a protractor, then tape a piece of string to the 90 degree line. Finally, you can add a small weight onto the string to allow it to stay straight. It is recommended you use something with a hole in it, like a washer or a potato

Zalzala Koh or Zalzala Jazeera, meaning "Earthquake Island", is a small island off the coast of the port city of Gwadar, Balochistan in south east of Pakistan. The island appeared on 24 September 2013, following an earthquake. It is believed to have been made by a mud volcano, where gas pushed up soil and mud from under the sea. The round island is about 15 m high and between 70 m and 90 m across. Gas is still escaping from cracks in the surface. Scientists believe that the island will not last for very long. Within months the level of the island had dropped by more than two metres, and it appears to be sinking backing into the sea.

Vegavis is a genus of extinct bird that lived during the latest Upper Cretaceous of Antarctica, some 66 million years ago (mya). Among modern birds, It is most closely related to ducks and geese (Anatidae).
The discovery shows that some of the major groups of bird alive today had already diversified in the Cretaceous. It has been hailed as the first definite physical proof that birds from some of the modern groups lived in the Mesozoic.
The "Vegavis" fossil specimen is held by the Museo de La Plata, Argentina. The very delicate remains of one bird are embedded in rock. Tomography (CT) scans were used to get a clearer picture of the bone structure without damaging or destroying the fossil.

Seawise Giant (known later as the Happy Giant, Jahre Viking, Knock Nevis, Oppama, and Mont) was a ULCC supertanker. It was the longest ship ever built and had the greatest deadweight tonnage that has ever been recorded. When it was heavily loaded, the ship had a displacement of 657,019 tonnes (646,642 long tons; 724,239 short tons) and had a draft of 24.6 m (81 ft). Due to it's size and lack of maneuverability, it was not able to move through the English Channel, Suez Canal or the Panama Canal.
The ship was built in 1979 by Sumitomo Heavy Industries at the Oppama shipyard in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan. The ship was sunk during the Iran–Iraq War but was salvaged, restored and put back into service. The ship sailed its final journey in December 2009 after being sold to Indian ship breakers. It was then intentionally beached in Alang, Gujarat, India and was demolished.

Presbyornis

Presbyornis is an extinct genus of water bird. It was a wading bird, often walking in shallow water on its long legs.
"Presbyornis" was one of the first anseriforms. Because of its long legs and neck, it was initially mistaken for a flamingo. Later it was reclassified as an anseriform when the duck-like anatomy of its skull and bill was found. It is from an extinct group closely related to ducks and geese. Judging from numerous fossil findings, "Presbyornis" probably lived in colonies around shallow lakes. Its broad, flat bill was used to filter food (small plants and animals) from the water, in the manner of today's dabbling ducks.
The fossil record includes many complete skeletons from Green River Formation sites (early Eocene). This suggests that the birds nested in colonies, similar to many colony-nesting waterfowl or shorebirds today. Species of this bird have also been found in Maryland, Utah, England, and Mongolia.
Fossils are held in the Smithsonian Institution, the Natural History Museum, London, and the KUVP.

In the 5th and 6th centuries there were seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Wessex.
Anglo-Saxon Christianity arrived in the 7th century. Viking invasions and Danish settlers started in the 8th century. The gradual unification of England under Wessex hegemony occurred during the 9th and 10th centuries.
Anglo-Saxon England ended with the Norman conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066.

The other half he gave to BC Science World in Vancouver and to the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology. He received the Royal Bank Award in 1999, and donated the grant to the BC Cancer Foundation.
Site-specific mutagenesis.
In 1978, Smith, with former Fred Sanger colleague Clyde A. Hutchison III, introduced a new technique into molecular biology. This technique, called "oligonucleotide-directed site-directed mutagenesis", showed how to find the effect of a single mutant gene. They developed a synthetic DNA. With this they compared different protein molecules to show what the mutation did.
The new technology allowed deliberate alteration of genes to change the characteristics of an organism. It helps new diagnostic strategies and new treatments for genetic diseases. It may even allow the creation of artificial forms of life.
The team's paper describing site-directed mutagenesis was published as "Mutagenesis at a specific position in a DNA sequence" in the "Journal of Biological Chemistry" in September 1978. For the team's work, Smith shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Kary Mullis, the inventor of the polymerase chain reaction.

Orange Caramel

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Orange Caramel is the first unit group formed from the South Korean pop group After School. This unit was formed with the 3 members: Nana, Raina and Lizzy.
Concept.
The style of Orange Caramel is Candy Culture which means to be cute, lively and fancy, but pure and sensitive. Their target is Asian market, so they got also Chinese name which is DeungJaChoDang(橙子焦糖).
They made two trends in Korean pop music. One is a unit group trend. After Orange Caramel was made, many unit groups were made, for example, from Girls' Generation, from Rainbow, from Sistar. Also the other is '선병맛 후중독' trend which means when you sees their show, it is hard to understand, but gradually and unconsciously you are addicted to it.
History.
Orange Caramel have released totally 11 albums. However, they mainly have done music activities with 6 songs (Magic Girl, A~ing♡, Bangkok City, Shanghai Romance, Lipstick, Catallena). Orange Caramel released its first album "Magic Girl" on June 21, 2010. Althought the concept of their original group, Afterschool, is sexy and strong, that of Orange Caramel were different. Their stage is very shocking to K-pop. At the same year, they released the second miuni album "A~ying♡". The song also had big effect on K-pop and its lyrics were controversial because the lyrics is so strange that it is hard to listen it. 
In 2011, they released the first single album "Bangkok City" for the global "One Asia project", and another album "Sanghai Romace" for the "Sanghai Project". These songs also succeeded in Korea music market. 
Orange Caramel released its first full-length album "lipstick" On September 12, 2012. 
They released the third single album "Catallena" On march 13, 2014.
Dress code.
Orange Caramel's songs and dances have been very shocking, and additionally their dress codes also have been major concerns. However, many said that their dress codes have been accordance with their songs.
On Magic Girl stage, they wore orange dresses and looked like fantasy magic girls. It was said that the color of the dresses were harmonized with the lively song. On their second music activity, A~ying♡, they dressed like a pricess. On the stage of Bangkok City, they wore club-style tight clothes, so their clothes were controversial because it was too sexually suggestive. In Sanghai Romance, as it is easy to imagine, they wore chinese style clothes. In Lipstick and Catallena, they were expected to wear unique clothes and as expected, they wore shocking sytle clothes.

Chungyang Red Pepper

Chungyang Red Pepper is one of the hottest chili pepper species ("Capsicum annum"). It is grown in Korea. It is a genetically improved strain of Thai and Jeju-do chili peppers. It was developed by Dr.Il-ung Yoo in 1983. Chungyang Red Peppers have 10,000~23,000 Scoville heat units in average.
The name Chungyang comes from the name of the county, Cheongsong and Yeongyang.
Plant property.
Red pepper grows well in high temperature. Proper temperature to grow is 25~28 °C during the day and 18~22 °C during the night. It's better not to drop the temperature under 13 °C. When temperature stabilizes in 20~25 °C it is the best time for plants to bear fruits. If the temperature drops under 15 °C or rise over 30 °C, fertility of the plant is seriously damaged resulting in windfall and malformed fruit.
Even though red pepper requires high temperature, it does not require that much of a sunlight. However, the deficit of sunlight in long-term can result in poor quality and number of the produce, so it is better to give adequate amount of sunlight. Light saturation point is 30,000 lx, which is lower than other typical vegetables.
Cultivation.
Most Chungyang Red Peppers are cultivated outdoors and some of them are cultivated indoors.
Outdoor cultivation.
Normally, farmers harvest peppers that are cultivated outdoors in late July. It ripens from the bottom and peppers placed closer to a root are more likely to ripen well and have more vivid red color. It can be harvested until we have the first frost and till then, we can harvest five times from one root in average. The quality of produce is affected by how many times have peppers being harvested. For example, if the root can bear fruits five times, then the first produce will have more thicker fruit skin and also the taste of it is better because the first one has strong sweet flavor and hot flavor at the same time in harmony. However, the color is little bit darker and less in red than the second or third one, so it is easy to be mistaken as worse produce than later produce.
Indoor cultivation.
Technically through indoor cultivation, farmers can harvest through out the year. There is no quality difference between the first produce and the last one like the case mentioned in outdoor cultivation. The one raised in this environment has taller stem body and bears more fruits than the one raised outdoors. Especially, because it stays always indoors, it doesn't get wet, so can block all kinds of diseases caused by excessive humidity. Because of these advantages, more and more farmers cultivate Chungyang Red Pepper indoors.

Biggest Festival between Korea University.
Korea-Yonsei Match also plays a role of the biggest festival of both Korea and Yonsei university. The two university shows another college rivalry like Harvard verses Yale University, Stanford University verses UC Berkeley, and in Korea, KAIST verses POSTECH, since they are the top two most famous private universities. During the Korea-Yonsei match, stores of each hometown, Anam and Sinchon, put many placards humiliating the rival in the streets. Huge festival in thrown in each town biannually. Festival takes place in Anam in even number years and in Sinchon in odd number years.
Human Train March.
One of the customs takes place during the festival is 'human train march'. People from each department make a long line and put their hands on the shoulder of front person making a long train-like rows. The human trains marches and wanders through streets.

Software release life cycle

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
A software release life cycle is the different stages of making a computer program, giving it out to other people, and making sure the computer program works right after it is released.
Stages of development (making the computer program).
Pre-alpha is the first stage of making a computer program. People making the computer program think up what the computer program should have in it, and start to actually create the computer program itself.
Alpha software is a computer program that can do most of what the programmers (people who make the software) want it to do, but it has lots of problems. Only the things that the programmers "really "want the software to do has been made without many problems.
A computer program goes into beta when programmers have made the software do everything it needs to do, but there may still be problems. The people who make the software then give it out to other people, so they can test whether the software works. Often, they find problems that they did not find in alpha.

Conwy Castle

Conwy Castle (Welsh: "Castell Conwy" 
 
) is a castle that was built in the Middle Ages. It is in Conwy, in the country of Wales. It was built by Edward I of England. He built it after he went to Wales and took over control of it, conquering it. He built it between the years of 1283 and 1289. It is part of the city walls. It cost £15,000 to build. The castle has survived wars like Madog ap Llywelyn. Richard II of England hid there in 1399. Owain Glyndŵr took it over in 1401, too. 
After the English Civil War started in 1642, people who supported Charles I of England took over the castle. They stayed there until 1646, which was when the Roundheads took it from them. When that war ended, the government partially destroyed the castle, so no one would use it. By 1665 it was completely destroyed because people had taken all of the iron and lead from the castle and sold it. Artists started making paintings of the castle in the 18th and 19th centuries. People started visiting it on vacation and it is now ran by Cadw. 
Conwy Castle was called one of the best Middle Ages military places in Europe by UNESCO. It is a World Heritage Site. The castle is rectangular. It is made from local stone and stone brought from other places. There are two parts of the castle: "Inner Ward" and "Outer Ward". It has eight towers and two barbicans. There is a gate which has a path that goes down to River Conwy. This path let the castle get supplies from boats and fishing. It has one of the oldest machicolation's in the country. It also has a bedroom which was used by kings and queens. The castle was based on the buildings made by James of Saint George. 
History.
1200s.
Conwy was a Cistercian monastery before it was a town. It was often visited by the Welsh princes. It is also a place where a person can cross the River Conwy going from the ocean area to the inland. The area has been owned by kings who have been from England and Wales since 1070. 
In 1282 Edward I of England attacked the castle. He had a big army. They came to the castle from the north. They came from Carmarthen. They also came from the West. The army came from Montgomery and Chester. The town of Aberconwy was captured by Edward in march 1283. He decided to use the castle as the center point for a county. There used to be an abbey where the castle was. Edward had the abbey relocated. He wanted to own the castle so that other people thought he was very powerful. 
After Edward decided to build the castle people started building it quickly. Sir John Bonvillars was the foreman for the building of the castle. A mason named James of St. George also worked on the project. They started building it in 1283. From 1283 until 1284 they built the walls and towers. Next, they built the buildings inside the castle walls. They also built walls for a town nearby. That took place between 1284 and 1286. They finished building the castle in 1287. People came from all over England to help build the castle. People would meet in Chester and walk to Wales to work at the castle. In total the project cost £15,000. That was a lot of money back then.
The castle had a person who was both constable and the mayor of Conwy. That person also managed 30 soldiers. A carpenter, chaplain, blacksmith, engineer, and stonemason worked at the castle. In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn started to fight against the people who ruled England. King Edward moved to Conwy to escape Madog ap Llywelyn. He lived at the castle from December 1294 until January 1295. He was only able to get supplies and food from the sea. Eventually, soldiers came and helped him in February. After that time, various people lived at the castle. This included Edward's son, who would become Edward II of England. He lived there in 1301.
1300s-1400s.
The castle fell apart during the 14th century because people did not take care of it. By the year 1321 the roof was leaking and the wood was rotting. In 1343, Edward, the Black Prince took over the castle. He fixed it with the help of Sir John Weston. Weston worked for Edward. They added a lot of things, including arches to the great hall. When Edward died, the castle fell apart again. 
Richard II of England started living in the castle towards the end of the century. He stayed there to escape Henry IV. When Richard got back from Ireland on August 12, 1399, and went to the castle, he met Henry Percy. Percy worked for Henry IV. The two talked to help stop the fighting. Percy promised to not hurt Richard. Richard surrendered on August 19 to Henry Percy at Flint Castle. He said he would stop being King if he was allowed to live, not die. Richard was taken to London. He died at Pontefract Castle.
A rebellion started in 1400, during the the rule of Henry IV. It was started by Owain Glyndŵr. This was just after Richard was told he was no longer king. Two cousins of Owain Glyndŵr, Rhys ap Tudur and his brother Gwilym, attacked the castle as a surprise. They dressed up like carpenters and acted like they were going to fix the castle. The got inside, killed two watchmen, and took over the castle. Their troops took over the town. The brothers lived there for about 3 months. They gave up after Henry IV promised to forgive them and they would not go to trial.
The castle was almost used during the War of the Roses but by the time the war ended it did not see any activity. The castle went through repairs in the 1520s and 1530s by Henry VIII. The castle was used as a prison and sometimes people who visited Conwy stayed at the castle.
1600s to today.
The castle had fallen apart again by the 1600s. It was sold to Edward Conway by Charles I in 1627. Edward bought it for £100. Edward's son, also named Edward, took over the castle in 1631. It was a ruin. In 1642, the English Civil War started. John Williams, Archbishop of York, took charge of the castle for the king. He used his own money to fix the broken parts of the castle. In 1645, Sir John Owen became governor of the castle. The two men argued about this, since Williams was supposed to be running it, not Owen. Eventually Williams gave up and moved back to London. The castle was taken over by Thomas Mytton between a siege in August and November of 1646. 
After the siege, Colonel John Carter became governor of the castle. He made more repairs to fix it. In 1655, the English Council of State was told, by the Parliament of England, to pull down the castle so people could not use it anymore. The Bakehouse Tower was partially torn apart during that time. The castle was given back to Edward Conway by Charles II as part of the Restoration. But, five years later Conway took all of the iron and lead that was on the castle and sell it to make money. A man named William Milward was in charge of taking the iron and lead off the castle. The people who lived in the town of Conwy protested the removal. Conway and Millward did not care and the castle became a complete ruin.
By the end of the 18th century the castle ruins were called "picturesque" and beautiful. People and artists would visit the castle from around the country. Artists would paint pictures of it, including the artists Thomas Girtin, Moses Griffith, Julius Caesar Ibbetson, Paul Sandby and J. M. W. Turner. Bridges were built over the River Conwy to the town from the Llandudno in the 1800s. The new bridges brought more tourists to the area. The two bridges included the Conwy Suspension Bridge, built in 1826, and the Conwy Railway Bridge, built in 1848. This allowed people with boats, cars, and riding in trains to visit the castle. The Holland family was running the castle, and in 1865 they gave it to the local government to run. The town helped to restore the ruins and they fixed the Bakehouse Tower. The castle was leased in 1953 to the Ministry of Works. They had Arnold Taylor start to fix the castle. He also researched the castle's history. A new road was built to the castle in 1958. It was going to be made into a monument by the country. In 1986 it was called a World Heritage Site.
Today it is ran by Cadw and tourists visit it. As of 2010, 186,897 people had visited the castle. They opened a new visitor center in 2012. The castle always has to be repaired. Between the years 2002 and 2003, it cost £30,000 to maintain and repair the castle.
Architecture.
The castle is considered one of the best "examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe," by UNESCO. It sits on the coast. The coast is is made up of a lot of rocks, including grey sandstone and limestone. Most of the stone that the castle was built out of is from this stone. The sandstone used to make carvings was brought from the Creuddyn peninsula, Chester, and the Wirral. That sandstone had more colors than the grey sandstone that was local. It might have been chosen not only because it was easy to carve, but also because it was pretty.
The castle is rectangular. It has two different sections, the Inner Ward and the Outer Ward. It has four towers. They are 70 ft and there is one on each side of the castle. The castle would have been painted white with lime render during it's early days. The towers have holes in them, called "putlog holes". These holes were used to help the builders build the towers, by putting wood timber pieces through the holes so they could climb up the towers. There are also square holes that are found in the castle walls. No one knows what they were used for. Maybe they were used to get rid of water when it rained, used for hoardings, or for displaying decorations. 
The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican. That barbican used to go over a drawbridge and a ramp from the town. Today, the path goes along the east side of the walls. The barbican has some of the oldest machicolation stones in Britain. In the early days, the gate to the castle was probably protected by a portcullis. 
Through the gate is the Outer Ward. When it was first built, this is where administrative duties were. People were handling business and management of the castle. This is where the northwest tower is located. People could live inside of it, and also store things. There is also the southwest tower, which was used by the constable. There was also a bakery inside of it. On the southside of the Outer Ward, there is a great hall and a chapel. There are also cellars. There is an old great arch from the 1340s. A [jail]] was located in a tower behind the great hall. There was a dungeon inside of it. The north side of the Outer Ward has a kitchen, brewery, bakery, and inside the tower people could live and store things.
There used to be a wall that separated the Inner Ward from the Outer Ward. The wall, which was located inside of the castle, had a drawbridge and a gate. There was also a ditch which made it hard to cross if the gate was closed. In the 16th century, the ditch was filled up so people could walk over it and the drawbridge was removed. This is where the spring that the castle gets it water from is located. The well is 91 ft deep. The Inner Ward is where the royal guests and residents lived. It is also where their staff and servants lived. The royal bedrooms, also called "chambers", are considered the finest preserved in England and Wales. The Inner Ward was supposed to look like a very small version of a royal palace. The reason the wall, gate, and ditch were built was so that if there was an emergency or an attack, the Inner Ward could be sealed off from the Outer Ward, which would fight against invasions.
The rooms where the royals lived were on the first floor in a series of small buildings. There were four protective towers for the Inner Ward. One of the towers was a chapel where the royals would have religious services. All of the towers had turrets for security. They also each displayed the royal flag. It is believed that this part of Conwy Castle was designed similar to that at Corfe Castle. The king could have his own private time while having a lot of security to keep him and all inside safe. There used to be two apartments inside, but eventually they were made into one apartment with three rooms. 
The east side of the Inner Ward has another barbican. This is where the castle garden is. The royal apartments could see the garden from their windows. There used to be grass there, and then vines, crab-apple trees, and flowers. There was a small gate that led to a small dock on the river. This allowed visitors to visit and leave the castle with very few people seeing them. It also allowed people to get supplies for the Inner Ward from boats.
The architecture is similar to that found in the kingdom of Savoy during the 13th century. This includes the way the windows were designed, the positioning of the "putlog" holes. Historians think that Conwy Castle was influenced by the work of architect Master James, from Savoy. The similarities to Savoy architecture might also be because many of the men who worked on building Conwy Castle were from Savoy.

Gender selection

Gender selection (or sex selection) is the attempt to control the gender of human offspring. It can be done either before or after the fertilisation of the egg. It has been promoted by the term family balancing.
In certain countries, particularly China, Nepal and India, sons are often preferred to daughters. In the United States, slightly more Americans preferred boys to girls.
The methods used for gender selection are of two main types. One occurs before fertilisation by making sure there are more sperms with a Y chromosome (which produce a male). The other acts after fertilisation by selecting only male embryos to develop.
Methods.
The Ericsson method uses the extra weight of sperms carrying the X chromosome. They swim slower than the lighter sperms with the Y chromosome. This test tube method increases the chance of having a boy from just over 50% to just over 70%. The method is called 'sperm sorting'.
The "in-vitro" fertilisation uses ovarian stimulation to cause the mother to produce a number of eggs. The eggs are fertilised in the laboratory by the father's sperm. Then the sex of embryos is discovered by taking a single cell from the ball of cells which has divided after fertilisation. One or more male embryos are then implanted in the mother's womb so they will develop.
Probably the most common method uses selective abortion. The sex of an embryo can be found by amniocentesis: cells are taken from the fluid surrounding the embryo. This is regularly done to identify genetic defects in the embryo. The procedure gives the information about sex early enough for abortion to be a safe practice.
Legality.
Sex selection has only recently become available. Sex selections are legal in most of the world. It is practiced mostly in Western countries, though more limited for Eastern countries, such as China and India. There is fertility tourism from the United Kingdom or Canada. That’s because preimplantation genetic diagnosis (a potential expansion of in-vitro fertilization that can be used for gender selection) is not allowed in Canada or the United Kingdom.

Embryo transfer

Embryo transfer is a medical procedure. It is a step in the process of assisted reproduction (also called fertility treatment), which uses science and medical treatments to help women who have difficulty getting pregnant. 
In embryo transfer, embryos are placed in a woman's uterus. The goal is to create a pregnancy. The embryos can be either fresh or frozen. If they are frozen, they are thawed right before they are transferred. Embryo transfer is the last step in a type of fertility treatment called in vitro fertilization.
Embryo transfer can be used for humans or animals.

Aglet

An aglet, or aiglet, is the small tip on the end of a shoelace or rope. It can be plastic or metal. It keeps the fibres from fraying or unwinding. This makes it easier to hold, and easier to feed through a hole, such as a grommmet, eyelet, or lacing guides.
The word "aglet" (or "aiglet") comes from the Old French word, "aguillette" (or "aiguillette"), which means "needle". This in turn comes from "acus", Latin for "needle". An aglet is like a small needle at the end of a cord.
Types.
There are two main types of aglets. Some are purely functional, that is to simply stop fraying, while others can also be decorative. Decorative aglets are on the end of decorative cords, such as bolo ties, or on the aiguillettes of military dress uniforms.
Aglets today are most often made of plastic; they also have been made of metal, glass, and stone. Many were highly ornamental and made of metals such as silver. Before the invention of buttons, they were used on the ends of ribbons to hold clothing together. Sometimes they were formed into small figures. Shakespeare called these an "aglet baby" in "The Taming of the Shrew".
Homemade aglets can be made out of adhesive tape, wax, resin, glue, thread, heat shrink or metal tubing, and by simply knotting or melting the end of a lace or cord. During the Great Depression, aglets were made out of paper and glue.

2014 Moncton shootings

The 2014 Moncton shootings were shootings that took place on June 4, 2014 in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. Three members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were shot and killed in Moncton. Two other RCMP officers were also injured in the attack. 24-year-old Justin Bourque is suspected of committing the shooting. He was caught after he was found in a yard on Mecca Drive and was taken into custody on June 6, 2014. After he was caught, he told police, "I'm done." The shooting lasted from June 4, 2014 to June 6, 2014. It was the first homicide in Moncton since 2010 and was the deadliest attack on RCMP members since the Mayerthorpe tragedy in 2005.
George LeBlanc, Mayor of Moncton said in a statement on Twitter that the shooting was "Terrible sad news for Moncton. Stay indoors and allow police to do their job. Prayers for the families." Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said in a statement "On behalf of all Canadians, Laureen and I offer our deepest condolences to the families, colleagues and friends of those affected by this tragedy. We also offer our prayers for the speedy recovery of those injured." He also said that the incident reminds us that "men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line in Canada every day to protect our citizens and communities".

RM4SCC

Royal Mail 4 State Customer Code (commoly abbreviated to RM4SCC) is a two-dimensional barcode that was develooped by Royal Mail in England. It is used for marking the postcodes of letters and parcels in the UK. The system, or one of its variants is also used in other countries. The printed code is optimized for being read at a high speed.
The barcode consists of a number of vertical bars. Each bar has one of four possible states. Four bars are necessary to code one of 36 possible characters. Two of the four bars point upwards, the other two point downwards. RM4SCC uses start and stop symbols. The RM4SCC barcode includes a checksum, which is also encoded as a character. 
There are other barcode systems, which are similar. TNT Post uses a system called KIX which stands for Klant index (Customer index). This system does not use the start and stop characters, and does not include a checksum.
Universal Postal Union has defined a standard how the system should be used.
Note that the code is read and printed at high speed, at which it is usually not possible to print straight lines; for this reason, the lines being "bent" is a normal state.

Garth Brooks (album)

</table>
Garth Brooks is the eponymous debut studio album of American country music artist Garth Brooks, released on April 12, 1989 through Capitol Nashville. It was both a critical and chart success, peaking at #13 on the "Billboard" 200. On the Top Country Albums chart the album peaked at #2 for eight weeks behind Clint Black's Killin' Time. In 2006 "Garth Brooks" was certified Diamond by the RIAA for shipments of 10 million copies in the US.
This album contains Brooks' earliest hits, for instance his first ever single, "Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)", which peaked at #8 on the Country Billboard Charts in 1989. It put the name of an independent cowboy singer, Chris LeDoux, into the mainstream due to the lyric "The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux" Two other strong starts include his first #1, "If Tomorrow Never Comes" and the Academy of Country Music's 1990 Song of the Year and Video of the Year, "The Dance" (another #1).
Background.
Brooks commented on the album, saying:
This album was released in April 1989, in the States. Definitely scared to death. I thought the album was very very innocent. And I gotta be truthful with you, every time I hear those songs off the radio or off the album itself, or even when we play them live. I really get that same kind of scared feeling, that I had, way back in 1988, and 1989. Whether you get the album or not, or whether you have the album or not. Thanks, for just, the interest. That first album is always a big one for any artist and I, without trying to sound egotistical, I'm very proud of my first one.

No Fences

No Fences is the second studio album by the American country music artist Garth Brooks. It was released on August 27, 1990, and reached #1 on "Billboard's" Top Country Albums chart. The album also reached #3 on the "Billboard" 200. On the latter chart it stayed in the top 40 for 126 weeks, only one week less than Shania Twain's "Come On Over", the Soundscan era's record holder. No Fences remains Brooks' best-selling studio album to date with 17 million copies shipped in the US, and is the album that made him an international star. It was his first album issued in Europe (the original European release contained the four singles from his U.S. debut as bonus tracks).
Some of Brooks' most famous songs appear on "No Fences", including: "The Thunder Rolls" (CMA's 1991 Video of the Year), "Friends in Low Places" (Academy of Country Music's 1990 Single of the Year), "Unanswered Prayers" and "Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House". A cover version of The Fleetwoods' "Mr. Blue" appears on the album. The album itself was named Album of the Year by the ACM in 1990. It reached Number 1 on the British country music charts (earning Brooks his first gold album in that country) and remained charted for over five years.
The track "Victim of the Game" was later covered by Brooks's friend and future wife Trisha Yearwood for her 1991 eponymous debut album.
Brooks later re-recorded the track "Wild Horses", and released the new recording as a single in early 2001, reaching #7 on the country chart.
Background.
Brooks commented on this album, saying:
"No Fences definitely, hands down would be the people's favorite album that we have done so far. It's by far our biggest selling album. With songs like Friends In Low Places, Two of a Kind, Unanswered Prayers, and especially The Thunder Rolls with all the attention it got with the video situation that it went through. It's probably not surprising that this is the biggest selling album of our collection. The number that we have sold surprises me to death, and this is a good time for me to say thanks to those people who have it. To those people who might be thinking about getting Fences, if you do, I hope that you don't feel like you've been let down. It's an album that I stand by, I'm very proud of. An album that I pull out from time to time and listen and hold my head up and say, yeah I'll still stand by it."
Track listing.
AThis track was not on the original release of the album. It first appeared when the album was re-released as part of Brooks' first "Limited Series" box set collection, and remained part of subsequent releases of the album until 2014, when it was released digitally for the first time.
Chart performance.
"No Fences" peaked at #3 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200, and peaked at #1 on the Top Country Albums selling 238,000 copies, his first #1 Country album.

Micromoth

Micromoths, or microlepidoptera is a group of moth families. They are very common, but much smaller than the more familiar butterflies and moths. They have wingspans of under 20 mm, and are hard to see well enough to identify. 
They have some lifestyles different from the larger lepidoptera, but this is not an identifying mark. The group is not monophyletic, so the term 'micromoth' is just a convenient label. It can be contrasted with macrolepidoptera, the larger types.

Keystone species

A keystone species is a species which has a big effect on its environment relative to its numbers. The ecosystem depends on them, and would be much changed if they were not there. This is because they affect many other organisms in the ecosystem. They affect the types and numbers of other species in the community.
Some sea stars (e.g. "Pisaster ochraceus") prey on sea urchins, mussels, and other shellfish that have no other natural predators. If the sea star is removed from the ecosystem, the mussel population explodes uncontrollably. This drives out most other species. The urchin population grows likewise, and destroys coral reefs. Living coral reefs are the habitat for many hundreds of other species.
Some other examples of keystone species are the sea otter, horseshoe crab, and wolves. Sea otters and kelp depend on each other. Without the sea otter, sea urchins would destroy the kelp, and much else in the ecosystem.

The Fire of Manisa refers to the burning of the city of Manisa in Turkey by the Greek army. It happened during the Greco Turkish War of 1919-1922. The town was burned between 5 and 8 September 1922. More than 10,000 buildings were destroyed. This was about 90 percent of the town. Thousands of people died in the flames or were shot dead by the Greeks. Turkish sources claim 4,355 died and 300 girls were raped.
The events.
The town of Manisa was part of the Ottoman Empire. Turks and Greeks were living there together. The Greeks wanted Manisa to become part of Greece. In May 1919 a Greek army occupied the town. Then there was war between Greeks and Turks for three years. In the summer of 1922 Turks defeated the Greeks. The Greeks fled to the Aegean Sea to be transferred to Greece. During their retreat the Greeks burned towns and villages of Turks. Manisa too was burned down. The local Turks fled to the mountains. Most of the town was destroyed and later rebuilt. Some Turkish authors wrote about their experiences in Turkish literature.

Lady tasting tea

Lady tasting tea is the name of a famous randomized experiment designed by Ronald Fisher in 1935. The experiment is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a null hypothesis. Fisher's description is less than ten pages long and is notable for its simplicity and completeness regarding terminology, calculations and design of the experiment. The example is loosely based on an event in Fisher's life. The lady in question was Muriel Bristol, and the test used was Fisher's exact test.
The experiment.
The lady in question claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance.
If and only if the Lady properly categorized all eight cups was Fisher willing to reject the null hypothesis – effectively acknowledging the Lady's ability at a 1.4% significance level (but without quantifying her ability). Fisher later discussed the benefits of more trials and repeated tests.
David Salsburg reports that a colleague of Fisher, H. Fairfield Smith, revealed that in the test, the woman got all eight cups correct. The chance of someone who just guesses getting all correct, assuming she guesses that four had the tea put in first and four the milk, would be only 1 in 70 (the combinations of 8 taken 4 at a time).
In popular science, Salsburg published a book entitled "The Lady Tasting Tea", which describes Fisher's experiment and ideas on randomization. Deb Basu wrote that "the famous case of the 'lady tasting tea'" was "one of the two supporting pillars . . . of the randomization analysis of experimental data".

Gram staining

Gram staining (or Gram's method) is a way of classifying bacteria into two large groups: gram-positive and gram-negative. The name comes from its inventor, Hans Christian Gram.
Gram's method stains bacteria according to the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls. First, a violet dye is put on the bacteria. This dye stains peptidoglycan, a thick layer that is only found in gram-positive bacteria. After the first stain, another stain (usually safranin or fuchsin) gives all gram-negative bacteria a red or pink colour. 
The Gram stain is almost always the first step in the identification of a bacterial organism. However, not all bacteria can be classified by this technique. Bacteria for which the method does not work are called 'gram-variable' or 'gram-indeterminate'.
Gram developed the technique working with another scientist, Carl Friedländer in a hospital in Berlin. However, Gram first used the test to make bacteria in the lungs easier to see. He published his finished method in 1884.

He was the son of Eddy and Amirus Darrow, a furniture manufacturer and dealer Amirus Darrow had originally trained as a minister,but just before his ordination he experienced a crisis of faith that led him to question the existence of God and the notion of life after death. Darrow briefly attended Allegheny College in Meadville ,Pennsylvania, then taught school for several years before enrolling at the University of Michigan Law School.
He is known for the famous trials he worked on like the Scopes trial about teaching evolution in schools, and the Leopold and Loeb murder trial. Sometimes he was called a "sophisticated country lawyer". His humor during trials, and his willingness to support civil rights, made him a famous lawyer.
Darrow spent the remaining years of his life in near seclusion. He died of heart disease at the age of eighty, respected by some and despised by others as a colorful rebel who was always willing to take on unpopular causes in the firm belief that they were the right ones to back-regardless of their impact on his career and his finaces.

Dyatlov Pass incident

The Dyatlov Pass incident is an unsolved mystery to the deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural mountains on the night of February 2, 1959. The incident happened on the east shoulder of the mountain Kholat Syakhl (Холат-Сяхыл, a Mansi name, meaning Dead Mountain). The mountain pass where the incident occurred has since been named "Dyatlov Pass" (Перевал Дятлова) after the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov (Игорь Дятлов). To this day, the incident has not been solved.
Background.
A group was formed for a ski trek across the northern Urals in Sverdlovsk Oblast. The group, led by Igor Dyatlov, consisted of eight men and two women. Most were students or graduates of "Ural Polytechnical Institute" (Уральский Политехнический Институт, УПИ), now Ural Federal University:
What killed the hikers?
It is not known what happened to the hikers. The most likely thing is that an avalanche hit them, and some of them struggled on until they died of cold and exposure. Only one hiker who left the group before the event happened survived. Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.
Theories.
There are many conspiracy theories towards what killed the hikers. Many Russians believe that a local tribe called the Mansi people killed them for trespassing on their property. Others believe that the military had something to do with their death. High levels of radiation was found on their clothing so some believe that a missile misfired and crashed nearby the hikers.
What investigators discovered.
Investigators at the time discovered that the hikers tore open their tent from inside, ran barefoot into heavy snow and a temperature of -30 C. Although the corpses showed no signs of struggle, two victims had fractured skulls, two had broken ribs, and one was missing parts of her face such as her tongue.

Scopes trial

The Scopes trial is formally known as "The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes". It is also referred to as the Scopes monkey trial. 
It was a famous American legal case in 1925. A substitute high school teacher, John Scopes, was accused of violating Tennessee's Butler Act. This Act made it unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school. The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held. 
Scopes was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution, but he purposely incriminated himself so that the case could have a defendant. 
Scopes was found guilty and fined $100, but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity. National reporters came to Dayton to cover the big-name lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate, argued for the prosecution, while Clarence Darrow, the famed defense attorney, spoke for Scopes. 
The trial publicized the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. This set "Modernists", who said evolution was not inconsistent with religion, against Fundamentalists, who said the word of God as revealed in the Bible took priority over all human knowledge. The case was thus seen as both a theological contest and a trial on whether modern evolutionary biology should be taught in schools.
The Tennessee law was not repealed until 1967.

Leopold and Loeb were Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. (November 19, 1904 – August 29, 1971) and Richard Albert Loeb (June 11, 1905 – January 28, 1936).
They were two wealthy University of Chicago law students who kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Robert "Bobby" Franks in 1924 in Chicago.
The duo was motivated to murder Franks by their desire to commit a perfect crime.
Once arrested, Leopold and Loeb hired Clarence Darrow as counsel for the defense. Darrow’s summation in their trial criticized capital punishment as retribution, rather than rehabilitation. Leopold and Loeb were sentenced to life imprisonment. Loeb was killed by a fellow prisoner in 1936; Leopold was released on parole in 1958.
The Leopold and Loeb crime has been the inspiration for several works in film, theatre, and fiction, such as the 1929 play "Rope" by Patrick Hamilton, and Alfred Hitchcock's take on the play in the 1948 film of the same name. Later movies such as "Compulsion" and "Swoon" were more accurate portrayals of the Leopold and Loeb case.

Fluvial terrace

Fluvial terrace is an abandoned floodplain with a long, narrow stairs that is formed when the river flowed at a higher level than at present. Fluvial terrace consists of two parts; a tread, which is the flat surface at the upper side of fluvial terrace, and a scarp, which is the steep slope connecting the tread to the downside. Fluvial terrace is divided into Rock terrace and Gravel terrace according to structure materials, and it is also classified as Tectonic terrace and Climate terrace according to causes of formation.
Classification.
Fluvial terraces are either called erosional or depositional.
Erosional terrace.
Erosional terrace is a terrace that the tread has been formed primarily by lateral erosion. During low water level stage, fine sediment is deposited and during normal flow, coarse sediment is deposited at the end of a high water event. When the river reaches its highest level, it entrains all the channel sediment and scours the underlying bedrock before coarse detritus is deposited again on the channel floor.
Depositional terrace.
Depositional terrace is a terrace that the tread represents the surface of a valley fill. Valley filling occurs when the amount of sediment produced in a basin exceeds the amount that the river system can carry away. It is usually triggered by glacial outwash, climate change, or change in base level, slope, or load caused by rising water level. Depositional terrace is climatically controlled, whereas erosional terrace is tectonically controlled.

Iditarod

The Iditarod is the world’s most famous dog sled race. It is an annual race that starts on the first Saturday of March in Anchorage, Alaska and ends in Nome, Alaska. The annual race crosses the Alaska Range and Kuskokwim Mountains range. The contestants in the race go northwest from Anchorage. Then they turn north and go along the Bering Sea to Nome. On even years they take the route that goes more north and on odd years they take the route that goes more south. White Mountain is the last of three rest stops for teams in the race. 
Iditarod is an endurance sport for the sled driver and the dogs. They have to keep moving for 1,100 miles. All the paths are cold, icy, and snowy. 12 to 16 dogs are in the race.
The current way the Iditarod is played today started in 1973. There were also shorter races that started in 1967. The first shorter race took place in the years from 1967 - 1973. The shorter races were held on the Iditarod trail which was an old mail route.

Gracie Gold

Childhood.
Gracie Gold was born on August 15th, 1995 in Newton, MA. When she was four years old her family moved to Springfield,IL. At a skating birthday party when she was eight years old, she began to try figure skating. After that party she signed up for lessons. She was a natural; she soon was landing double axels! 
Before Olympics and other competitions.
After awhile her hard work wasn't paying off. She kept getting low scores! Around a year before the Sochi, Olympics Gracie's relationship with her coach, Alex Ouriashev had completely crumbled. A little while after that Gracie switched coaches. She switched to Frank Carroll and this switch took her mother and sister Carly Gold with her to Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles. Frank Carroll’s experience with coaching other Olympians like Evan Lysacek, Michelle Kwan, Tim Goebel, Linda Fratianne and Denis Ten helped and inspired Gracie. Going to the Olympics gave a lot of stress to her. She would stress about being an Olympian and would stress out about all of the mistakes she would make in practice. Sometimes to calm down Gracie would juggle. She had to learn how to relax while doing her triple axels and how to save a jump if she started off wrong. Gracie also had to learn how to make her performance still look good to the judges, even after a fall. Later, after all of this training Gracie was ready to compete in competitions like the Midwestern sectional, The U.S. Championships, and the U.S. International Classic. In almost all of her later competitions she did better than the firsts. This helped her earn her spot in the 2014 Sochi, Olympics! 
Sochi, Olympics.
Gracie got a bronze medal from the Olympics, she got this from the team event. In the Ladies free skate, and short program she was placed fourth. Gracie is eager to return to Olympic Ice in the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Gayageum

The gayageum or kayagum is a traditional Korean zither-like string instrument. It has 12 strings, though some more recent variants have 21 or other numbers of strings. It is probably the best known traditional Korean musical instrument. Its body is made of Paulownia wood.
History.
According to Samguksagi ( the three kingdoms history book), the first gayageum was made for King Gasil in the 6th century. This was after he observed a Chinese musical instrument. He ordered a musician named Wu Ruk to compose music for this new instrument. The original name was "gayago". It was further improved by Wu Ruk.
Construction.
There are two types. The "beobgeum gayageum" is 160cm long by 30cm wide by 10cm deep. Its body is made of a single piece of paulownia wood. The resonator chamber is hollowed out of the wood body. It is used in court music.
The "sanjo gayageum" is about 142cm long by 23cm wide by 10cm deep. The soundboard is made of paulownia, but the sides and back are of a harder wood such as chestnut or walnut. It is used in folk music.
Technique.
The player usually sits cross-legged. The gayageum is played put on the player’s knee (usually the right knee). One hand plucks the strings to make a sound. The other hand decorates the sound by pressing, shaking, and vibrating the strings.

Legal guardian

A Legal guardian is a legal system to protect a person who cannot make legal decisions and needs legal protection. There are some cases in which a person needs a legal guardian.
A legal guardian law is conducted in these cases :
Appointing a legal guardian.
Generally, a legal guardian is appointed by Courts. An incompetent person announced by law cannot be appointed as a guardian. 
A non-relative person can be a legal guardian. - that is, it doesn't have to be a relative by blood. For example, a child who has no parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters can have a guardian who is a distant cousin of the child. 
There are three kinds of guardian:
Challenges and Solutions in Korea.
In Korea, a lineal relation, a near relation (or kin) or an elder takes a preferential right to be appointed as a guardian. It causes the problem that guardian can have practical difficulty giving legal assistants. Also, the number of the guardian is limited to one and it is difficult for the guardian to help a Ward in both social -positioning function and financial function. It is too demanding for the guardian to perform both functions alone. In Korea, the pay of a guardian is from property of the Ward. But, if a ward may not have property enough to pay for a guardian, it makes the role of guardian negative or passive.
To solve these problems, the system that allows having more than two guardians should be introduced. Also, the government should support the pay for guardians.

Grandaddy

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Grandaddy is an American indie rock band formed in California in 1992 by singer/guitarist/keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia, and drummer Aaron Burtch.
History.
Complex Party Come Theories is their first work. After that, they got new guitarist Jim Fairchild and keyboardist Tim Dryden. They released EP A Pretty Mess By This One Band in 1996, and their first full-length album Under The Western Freeway in 1997. “Summer Here Kids”, one of the songs in Under The Western Freeway, earned Single of the Week honors in NME. In 2000, in Sophftware Slump, they created vintage, electronic, drift-off music. In , Concrete Dunes was released, without the band's permission. In 2003, the group released another album, Sumday, and received good reviews. In 2006, Just Like the Fambly Cat was released. 
After the album, the band broke up in 2005. They did not do Just Like the Fambly Cat tour concert. The band was utterly content and happy about the decision to end Grandaddy. In the song 'Elevate Myself', he says "I don't wanna work all night and day. On writing songs that make the young girls cry." Other members all worked in their own field, but Jim Fairchild was still working with music. He joined a guitarist in Modest Mouse tour, and he released his first solo album, Ten Readings of a Warning. In 2012, the band reunited for Outside Lands Festival in San Francisco. In the same year, they played in End of the Road Festival. No album has been released since then. 
In an interview, Jason Lytle tell why the band name got their name Grandaddy; They realized that they are too ugly to seduce young women, so they try to appeal to old women, just like Morrissey. Birds frequently appear in their album cover, because birds are beautiful and colorful, and they can sing.
Style.
Grandaddy's music has features in the late 90s lo-fi indie rock. Their music has the catchy melodies that they are able to create with the synths and distorted guitars. Most of their musics are slow and emotional. Also, they used electronics. Their lyrics are mostly vague and abstract, but inventive. The album's most enduring image is a man sipping a beer and strumming an acoustic guitar in quiet, beautiful countryside. The Sophtware Slump is generally regarded as the band's masterpiece, but other albums like Under the Western Freeway are popular, too.

Aztec mythology is the mythology of the Aztec civilization in Mexico. It was the basis on which they made a working and advanced society. They took some ideas from the Toltec and Mayans to create their advanced culture. Their empire lasted from the 14th century until the Spanish took over. 
The Aztecs believed the universe went through four phases. They called them suns. They believed that they lived in the fifth sun. The gods ended each sun with a huge tragedy and then created a new world. In the first sun, the world was destroyed by jaguars. In the second, the world was destroyed by a storm. In the third sun, the earth was destroyed by a fire rain. At the end of the fourth, the world was destroyed by a huge flood. They believed that the fifth sun would end with a huge earthquake.
In their religion they worshipped many gods and goddesses. They even made human sacrifices. There were three parts of the body that they considered the most powerful: the head, the heart, and the liver. 
Some gods and goddesses in Aztec mythology are Huitzilopochtli, Tezcatlipoca, and Xochiquetzal.

Malagasy is an Austronesian language that is spoken in Madagascar. It is an Austronesian language. It is related to languages such as Maori and Javanese. That means that Malagasy is like languages spoken in Indonesia. This is probably because immigrants from Indonesia came to Madagascar until A.D. 1400. It is the only Austronesian language spoken in Africa.
Writing.
Malagasy is written using the English alphabet, but without c, q, u, w and x. No accents or other diacritical marks are used. It was invented by David Jones as a replacement for Sorabe (a type of Arabic script). Most letters have their IPA values. However, y and i are both pronounced like /i/ and h is often silent. A few consonant digraphs (tr, dr, ts) are used.
Examples of words.

R/K selection theory

r/K selection theory describes the way a species controls its number of offspring. 
r-selection species produce many offspring. K-selected species focus on a few. Neither method is in itself superior, and they may occur in the same habitat; e.g., rodents (r-selection) and elephants (K-selection). 
The theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but several studies criticized it. The study of life histories has replaced the r/K selection paradigm.
The terminology of r/K-selection was coined by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson, based on their work on island biogeography. Study of the evolution of life history strategies actually has a longer history.

Oppositional defiant disorder

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental disorder. It is a pattern of irritable or angry behavior lasting at least 6 months and is seen during interaction with other people. Unlike those with conduct disorder, though, most people with ODD do not usually get aggressive towards other people or animals, steal or cause destruction. People with ODD, however, do argue and deliberately, often cause trouble.
Symptoms.
In order to be diagnosed with ODD, the person must have a behavior pattern lasting at least six months. At least four of these eight symptoms must be present for that time:
About 10.2% of people have or have had ODD (11.2% of males and 9.2% of females). In many cases this condition worsens into conduct disorder, which often worsens into antisocial personality disorder. This is more likely in boys than girls, and more likely if the person also has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. ODD typically begins in childhood. It is the most common mental disorder in children. It is unusual in adults, because the affected person usually either recovers or develops ASPD. 
ODD is more common in family members of people who have ODD, CD or ASPD. It is more common in poor urban areas. 
Most people who have ODD also have other mental disorders, most often ADHD. Many children who have ODD have problems with alcohol and drugs in their adolescence and adulthood.

RCA

RCA Corporation, originally the Radio Corporation of America, was an American electronics company. It was in existence from 1919 to 1986. The RCA trademark is used by Sony Music Entertainment and Technicolor, which licenses the name to other companies. Some of these are Audiovox and TCL Corporation.
History.
After World War I began in August 1914, the western Allies cut the German transatlantic telegraph cables. This caused a tremendous increase in radio traffic across the Atlantic Ocean. The General Electric corporation bought the stock of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America in 1919. With this they formed the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). After the golden age of Radio had passed, RCA began to decline. In 1982 they ended most of their public affairs programs. Finally, in 1986, General Electric bought back RCA, along with NBC, for $6.28 million.

Plitt Theatres

Plitt Theaters was a major movie theater chain in the United States. It was originally the theater division of Paramount Pictures. This included a number of theater circuits acquired by Paramount, notably Balaban and Katz. In the late 1930s the United States government filed an antitrust lawsuit against five Movie studios. As a result Paramount was required to split off their theater chain. 
On December 31, 1949, the theater business was spun off into an independent company called United Paramount Theaters (UPT). It was headed by Leonard Goldenson. In 1953 UPT purchased the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). This provided ABC's television network with a source of cash flow that allowed it to survive and eventually become competitive. The new company was named American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters. In 1965 the corporation was renamed American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. The theater chain was renamed ABC Theaters. In 1974 ABC sold its movie theaters in the Midwest (a division called ABC Great States) to one of its executives, Henry Plitt, doing business as Plitt Theaters. Plitt subsequently bought the ABC Southern theater operations in 1978. In 1985, Plitt Theaters was sold to Cineplex Odeon Corporation.

Reception.
IGN rated the game a 4 out of 10 and said that "with the exception of the four-player combat and Rob Zombie's hard-rock soundtrack -- the two great things about the game -- Twisted Metal 3 is a middle-of-the-road game that unfortunately doesn't do anything more than the first two games. In fact, it's just plain old hat."
GameSpot's Joe Fielder said that the game's soundtrack by Rob Zombie and Pitchshifter was "fitting" but he criticized the "lackluster" level design and "strange" physics engine. He advised readers to check out Activision's "Vigilante 8" or GT Interactive's "" instead.

The Hunger Games trilogy

The Hunger Games is a trilogy of books by Suzanne Collins which tells the story of Katniss Everdeen (16) in these games. In the first book, Katniss replaces her sister Primrose Everdeen (12) in the hunger games because Prim is very weak and fragile. The hunger games are a competition of the nation of Panem (the present day United States), which is divided in 12 Districts. In these games 12 boys and 12 girls between 12 and 18 years old learn the rules of survival and fight one another to the death until only one survives. The boys and girls are named tributes and represent their Districts. A menace of the games are the Muts. The Muts are mutant wolves. The origin of the competition was the Nuclear War of the Dark Years, when the districts rebelled against the Capitol. The Districts lost the war and the Capitol won. The champion of the games lives in a special village in their districts and they are given money and jewellery and their family will not be elected for the games again.
The life in the Districts is very different from the life in the capitol. In the Capitol the people do not work and they are rich. In the districts the people work very hard and they are not rich except in districts 1, 2 and 4. 
In the 74th hunger games Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark (16) participate and win because the rest of the tributes have died and both menace to eat nightlocks, a poisonous berry which kills in a moment. Snow, Panem’s president, doesn’t like it because he needs a Champion so that the people in Capitol and the Districts won’t rebel. The principal tributes are Marvel (killed by Katniss) and Glimer (killed by Katniss) (district 1), Cato (killed by Katniss) and Clove (killed by Tresh) (district 2), Foxface (killed by the nightlocks) (district 5) and Tresh (killed by the muts) and Rue (killed by Marvel) (district 11). In the end of the book, Katniss and Peeta return to district 12 and Seneca Crane, the guard of the games, is killed by president Snow with nightlocks.

Development.
WWE 2K15 is the first attempt in the series at a next-generation game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Justin Gabriel released a photo on his official Instagram of himself getting "scanned" for what appears to be the Eco-Motion engine that was used in "NBA 2K14"'s next generation game. Former "NXT" Chris Hero (Kassius Ohno) also did some motion-captioning for the game.
2K's community manager, Ronnie Singh described the Eco-Motion engine as "One example of the Eco-Motion Engine in action is the new fluid nature of player animations. Gone are the days of pre-canned animations that must play out exactly as they were mocapped. Now, players adjust their movements based on the environment around them."

Izmit massacre

The Izmit massacre ocurred on 24 June 1921 in the town of Izmit, Turkey. It was a mass killing of some 300 Turkish civilians by the retreating Greek army. It happened during the Greek-Turkish war of 1919-1922. British journalist Arnold Toynbee landed at the town after the Greek retreat and saw the aftermath.
Background.
Izmit was a coastal Ottoman town with a mixed population of Turks, Greeks and others. In the last years of the Ottoman Empire it was occupied by the Greek army in 1920. The local Greeks wanted to join Greece. The Turkish nationalists were opposed to join Greece and fought against the Greek troops in the surrounding of the town. Then the Greek army decided to retreat in June 1921. The local Christians also fled with the Greek army and lost their non movable property. Before the Greeks left they looted the Turks, partly burned the town, burned some surrounding villages and desecrated the mosques of Izmit. On 24 June they killed more than 300 people in the cemetery. Thousands of Turks hid in the French college to find safety. Izmit was occupied by the Turkish army on 28 June 1921. Most of the Christians never returned back to the town.

101st Airborne Division

The 101st Airborne Division is an infantry division in the United States Army. It was called an "airborne" division because, as a paratrooper unit, it used airplanes to go into battle. It is most famous its defense of Bastogne at the Battle of the Bulge. The division later fought in the Vietnam War, including the Battle of Hamburger Hill. It also fought in the Gulf War, War in Afghanistan, and War in Iraq.
History.
The 101st Division was organized 2 November 1918 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. World War I ended 9 days later. The unit was disbanded on 11 December 1918.
The unit was made active again on 10 September 1921, at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They were assigned to the United States Army Reserve. At this time the "Screaming Eagle" nickname became associated with the division. They assumed several traditions as a successor to the volunteer regiments of the American Civil War. In order to reorganize the 101st as an airborne division in the (regular) U.S. Army, the reserve division was disbanded on 15 August 1942.
World War II.
The 101st Airborne Division was activated in the U.S. Army on 16 August 1942. This was at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. On 19 August 1942, its first commander, Major General William C. Lee, promised his new recruits that the 101st had "no history but had a rendezvous with destiny." On D-Day (6 June 1944) the 101st Airborne Division parachuted behind the enemy lines in back of Utah Beach. They cleared a path for the beach landings and captured several key objectives. The division took part in Operation Market Garden (17–25 September 1944). This was the largest airborne operation of all time.

Parliament of Great Britain

The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707. This was because of the ratification of the Acts of Union 1707 by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved (or ended) the separate English and Scottish parliaments. The British parliament was located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Act of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom. It became effective 1 January 1801.

Interlanguage fossilization occurs in adults learning a new language. In language learning, unlike the child, adults can't about language rules and grammar.

In other words, the native language interferences hold adults back from improving language . Therefore, there are many adults language learners who experience the interlanguage fossilization.
"Acceptance" of a new culture can also cause interlanguage fossilization. If the learners are in new country, then they have to learn a new language. When the learners are in new cultures, they try to make it themselves to new circumstances. At first, they feel nervous because there are big cultural differences. Therefore, the learners study hard. However, after time goes by, people stop studying a new language because they cannot feel nervous anymore. The learner think that they are fully in the new culture and they are with their new language proficiency. Then, interlanguage fossilization happens.

Portmeirion

Portmeirion is a tourist village in Gwynedd, North Wales. The village is in the community of Penrhyndeudraeth. Its is next to the River Dwyryd. It was created and built by Clough Williams-Ellis. He created and built it between the years 1925 and 1975. He wanted it to look like an Italian village. A charity owns it. Many movies and television shows were filmed there, including "The Prisoner".
History.
Portmeirion looks a lot like the Italian city of Portofino. But, Clough Williams-Ellis, who created Portmeirion, always said that it was "not" based on the city of Portofino. He said he did want it to look like it was a place near the Mediterranean, though. He designed and built the village between the years of 1925 and 1975. The mix of architecture in the village is believed to have influenced postmodernism architecture in the late 1900s.
An old estate used to be located on the property before Portmeirion was built. It was called "Aber Iâ" (Welsh: "Ice estuary" 
 
). The hotel and three cottages, which are named "White Horses", "Mermaid", and "The Salutation", are part of the original estate. It was built in the 1850s. Before the estate, there was a foundry and a boatyard on site. There is also an old site which has a small group of remains from a mediaeval castle nearby. 
In 1931, Williams-Ellis bought a Victorian mansion from his uncle Sir Osmund Williams, Bt. It was called Castell Deudraeth. Williams-Ellis planned on having the mansion be a part of the hotel. Lots of problems and the war did not allow that to happen. Williams-Ellis loved the building a lot and did anything he could to make it a part of the hotel. He received money from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, and Wales Tourist Board. This money allowed him to finally open Castell Deudraeth as a hotel with 11 bedrooms and a restaurant on August 20, 2001. Bryn Terfel performed at the opening. 
There are a lot of rhododendrons at Portmeirion, which are part of gardens that go throughout the land. The gardens were started before Williams-Ellis lived there. They were started by George Henry Caton Haigh. An English charity owns Portmeirion, today. It is still a hotel. There is also a cafe, cottages for rent, shops, a tearoom, and a restaurant. 
Lewis Mumford has written a lot about Portmeirion. He wrote a lot about it in his book, "The Highway and the City" in 1964.
Popular culture.
A lot of people have found inspiration in Portmeirion. Noël Coward wrote the play "Blithe Spirit" while staying in a cottage at Portmeirion. Frank Lloyd Wright, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul McCartney have visited. Jools Holland visited it while he was making a TV show called "The Tube". He loved Portmeirion so much that he used its type of architecture in building his recording studio and house in Blackheath. 
The village is used in many movies and television shows to look like the shows are taking place in an exotic place in Europe. Episodes of "Danger Man", "Doctor Who", and "The Prisoner" have been filmed at Portmeirion. Many bands and musicians have recorded videos, songs, and held concerts there to do with "The Prisoner", including Supergrass, Iron Maiden, XTC, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and a music festival called Festival N°6.

Sirius Passet

Sirius Passet is a special fossil site, a lagerstätte in Greenland. It is from six places on the eastern shore of a fjord in the far north of Greenland. It was discovered in 1984. About 10,000 fossil specimens have been collected so far.
The fauna is just before that of the Burgess Shale, probably ten to fifteen million years older – 518 vs. 505 mya. 
The fauna includes some arthropods and sponges, and rare representatives of other groups. A polychaete annelid from the Sirius Passet was described in 2008. Polychaete annelids are a significant part of the Burgess Shale fauna, but are otherwise unknown from the other early Cambrian lagerstätten. This single species from a single place improves our knowledge of this group.

Menai Suspension Bridge

The Menai Suspension Bridge (Welsh: "Pont Grog y Borth" 
 
) is a suspension bridge in Wales. It runs from the island of Anglesey to Holyhead. It was designed by Thomas Telford. They started building it in 1819 and it was finished in 1826.
Building of the bridge.
Before the bridge was built, the only way people could get to Anglesey island was by a ferry from Holyhead. The water of the Menai Strait is very rough and dangerous, so it was hard for people to use their own boats or swim to the island. The people who lived on Anglesey sold cattle that they raised. The cattle were forced to swim through the dangerous water, with many of them often dying. If the cows survived the trip, they were sent to London and other places to be sold. 
An engineer named Thomas Telford was working near Holyhead when he thought it would be a good idea to build a suspension bridge to Anglesey. A suspension bridge was big enough that tall ships could go underneath them. He asked the British Parliament if he could build the bridge and they said yes.
Telford designed the bridge. They started building it in 1819. The first thing to be built were the towers that are on both sides at Holyhead and Anglesey. The towers were made out of limestone from Penmon. They were hollow inside. After the towers were built, 16 chains were installed. They were made out of 935 bars of iron. They were long enough to support the 176 m long bridge. Iron can rust. So, the people who made the chains soaked them in linseed oil and the painted. The chains were 522.3 m long and weighed 121 tons. The bridge opened on January 30, 1826.
Bridge improvements.
The road that went over the bridge was not very safe because of the strong winds. Workers made the bridge stronger in 1840. The bridge road was made of wood, and in 1893 it was replaced with steel. The bridge only allowed cars and trucks that weighted up to 4.5 tons to go over the bridge. This made it hard for big trucks to bring goods to the island. In 1938 they installed wrought iron chains to make the bridge strong. In 1999, the bridge closed for one month. The road was fixed and the bridge was made stronger. When it was closed, people had to drive over the Britannia Bridge to get to the island. 
One part of the bridge was closed for six months starting on February 28, 2005. The bridge was painted for the first time in 65 years. It was reopened on December 11.
Surroundings.
The Anglesey Coastal Path goes under the bridge. There is a memorial to the Aberfan disaster victims at the bridge on Anglesey.
Popular culture.
The closest town to the bridge is called Menai Bridge. British one pound coins have drawings of the bridge. The coins were made in 2005. The bridge is mentioned in "Through the Looking-Glass" by Lewis Carroll.

D (programming language)

The D programming language is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language. D language originated as a re-engineering of C++, and D's design goals try combining the performance of compiled languages with the safety and expressive power of modern dynamic languages. Native D code is commonly as fast as equivalent C++ code, while being shorter and memory-safe.
Examples.
Example 1.
This example program prints its command line arguments. The codice_1 function is the entry point of a D program, and codice_2 is an array of strings representing the command line arguments. A codice_3 in D is an array of characters, represented by codice_4 in D1, or codice_5 in D2.
import std.stdio: writefln;
void main(string[] args)
 foreach (i, arg; args)
 writefln("args[%d] = '%s'", i, arg);
The codice_6 statement can iterate over any collection. In this case, it is producing a sequence of indexes (codice_7) and values (codice_8) from the array codice_2. The index codice_7 and the value codice_8 have their types inferred from the type of the array codice_2.
Example 2.
The following shows several D capabilities and D design trade-offs in a very short program. It iterates the lines of a text file named codice_13 that contains a different word on each line, and prints all the words that are anagrams of other words.
import std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range, std.string;
void main()
 dstring[][dstring] signs2words;
 foreach(dchar[] w; lines(File("words.txt")))
 w = w.chomp().toLower();
 immutable key = w.dup.sort().release().idup;
 signs2words[key] ~= w.idup;
 foreach(words; signs2words)
 if(words.length > 1)
 writefln(words.join(" "));

A transatlantic telegraph cable is a cable running under the Atlantic Ocean. It was used for telegraph communications. The first was laid across the bottom of the Atlantic from Ireland to Newfoundland. The first message was sent on August 16, 1858. It was from Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan. The cables reduced the communication time between North America and Europe from ten days (by ship) to a matter of minutes. The first cable lasted only three weeks. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by transatlantic telecommunications cables.

Tribune of the plebs

Tribunes of the plebs were important officials in Ancient Rome. Their purpose was to provide a balance between the power of the Senate and the needs of the people. There were ten tribunes at any time, and they could act separately or together. 
These tribunes had the power to use the People's Assembly (the Concilium Plebis) to support the common people. They could summon the Senate, propose legislation and intervene on the behalf of plebeians in legal matters. Most important of all was the power to veto the actions of the Consuls and other magistrates, to protect the interests of the plebeians. An assault on any plebian tribune was against the law.
Tribunes of the plebs were elected by the People's Assembly alone. They could be commoners, unlike all the other officials of the Roman Republic. Their role lasted for about 800 years, but under the Roman Empire they did not have real powers. They were in origin and style, a working part of the Roman Republic. 
Although a tribune could veto any action of the magistrates, Senate, or other assemblies, he had to be physically present in order to do so. Once the tribune was no longer present, the action could be completed as if the veto had not occurred. This meant that the tribunes' powers were limited to Rome itself, not the Republic in general.

Meju

Meju is a brick of fermented soybeans in Korean cuisine. It is used in Korean cuisine to make essential condiments such as soy sauce(Kanjang), soybean paste(Doenjang) and red chilli pepper paste(Gochujang). Meju is produced by drying a brick of soybeans. The brick of soybeans is naturally fermented while it dries. There are several ways to make a brick of soybeans. Traditionally, boiled soybeans were crushed in a mortar and made into a brick shape to be tied up with straw.
"Meju" was commonly made in any Korean home in the past. Condiments made with mejus tasted all different because the production of meju was not standardized. As many Koreans now buy Korean traditional condiments instead of making them, it is difficult to find the wide variety of unique tasting condiments made from homemade meju.
History.
The meaning of the word ‘Meju’ originally included all condiments and seasonings made with meju. However, as another word ‘jang’ was used more frequently to refer to condiments made with meju, the meaning of the word ‘Meju’ shifted to refer only to the stage before it is used in condiments. Scholars believe the Japanese word ‘Miso’ which is similar to Korean doenjang has the same origin as ‘Meju’.

Lee Alexander McQueen (17 March 1969 – 11 February 2010) was a British fashion designer and couturier. His creative and experimental design received a lot of attention in the world of fashion.
Early life and education.
McQueen was born on 17 March 1969 in Lewisham, London. He started drawing at age three. He wanted to be a designer since he was in primary school. McQueen left school at age 16 and started to serve an apprenticeship with Savile Row tailors in 'Anderson & Sheppard'. Afterwards, he also worked for 'Gieves & Hawkes', which made stage costumes for famous shows in London. The skills he learned as an apprentice on Savile Row helped him to get a reputation in the fashion world. At the age of 21, McQueen was hired by Romeo Gigli as assistant designer in Italy.
Career.
In 1994, McQueen returned to London and got a master's degree from Central Saint Martins College. It was the turning point that led him to be a designer. McQueen worked at Givenchy as a head designer from 1996 to 2001. After he separated with Givenchy, he focused on his own label. Then, in 2001, he made a debut with "The Dance of the Twisted Bull" collection in Paris which provoked some scandals.
In 2001 "Gucci" Group got 51% shares of Alexander McQueen brand, which was named after McQueen, and became his new partner. As time passed, McQueen launched "McQ" as second brand, and "My Queen" as perfume brand. McQueen also conducted various brand and design collaboration with Puma, Samsonite and Chivas Regal. By the end of 2006, Alexander McQueen brand has entered 25 cities including London, Paris, New York, Boston, Milan, Moscow, Tokyo and Seoul.
In 1996, he was nominated as the youngest British Fashion Designer of the Year, and again in 1997, 2001 and 2003. Moreover, in 2003 he was nominated as by Council of Fashion Designers of America(CFDA) and received 'Commander of the Order of the British Empire' from Queen. From mid 1990s to 2000s, he had success in his career.

Germany took the lead after Thomas Müller scored a penalty that was awarded to them after the foul by João Pereira. Mats Hummels doubled their advantage after he scored from a corner that was taken by Toni Kroos. Shortly before half time, Pepe got a red card and Thomas Müller scored again. Thomas Müller scored the final goal at the 78th minute, which finished the game at 4–0.
Ghana vs. United States.

The game went on without goals until Jermaine Jones's goal equalized the game from a corner. The Americans took the lead after Clint Dempsey scored from Graham Zusi's cross. Luckily for the Portuguese, Varela scored at the last minute from a cross from Cristiano Ronaldo. Varela's goal was one of the latest goals in FIFA World Cup history.
United States vs. Germany.

<doc id="454190" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454190" title="Limit of a sequence">
Limit of a sequence

In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of events. Each event consists of a mathematical object, which is a number in many cases. In some cases, the sequence tends towards a limit. In this case, the sequence is said to be convergent, otherwise it is divergent.
In a convergent sequence, the absolute difference between the value of the current element and the limit, formula_1 will decrease as the sequence progresses. 
Formal Definition.
We call formula_2 the limit of the sequence formula_3 if the following condition holds:
In other words, for every measure of closeness formula_8, the sequence's terms are eventually that close to the limit. The sequence formula_3 is said to converge to or tend to the limit formula_2, written formula_11 or formula_12.
If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is convergent; otherwise it is divergent.
History.
The Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea is famous for formulating paradoxes that involve limiting processes.
Leucippus, Democritus, Antiphon, Eudoxus and Archimedes developed the method of exhaustion, which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a geometric series.
Newton dealt with series in his works on "Analysis with infinite series" (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), "Method of fluxions and infinite series" (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and "Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum" (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his "Optiks"). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of ("x"+"o")"n" which he then linearizes by "taking limits" (letting "o"→0).
In the 18th century, mathematicians like Euler succeeded in summing some "divergent" series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, Lagrange in his "Théorie des fonctions analytiques" (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. Gauss in his etude of hypergeometric series (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit.
The modern definition of a limit (for any ε there exists an index "N" so that ...) was given by Bernhard Bolzano ("Der binomische Lehrsatz", Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by Karl Weierstraß in the 1870s.

Random walk hypothesis

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Random walk hypothesis is created as a neo-classical consumption function by Robert E. Hall, and it is related to an expectation theory in macro economics. This gives basis of how individuals do economic decision of present period and is used to calculate an amount of the macro consumption from an economic world.
This theory starts with Freidman's permanent income hypothesis and Lucas's rational expectation hypothesis. Before this theory was made, other expectation theories basically assume that people irrationally think sometimes making decision based on the past (already reflected in the market) facts or falling into the illusion. But Lucas argued that the market players use all the information available at the moment in order to pursuit utility maximization. Permanent income hypothesis supposes people try to decide the amount of consumption expecting the impacts of a certain incident throughout the whole periods of time.
Random walk hypothesis concludes rational expectation to consumption of the next period is the present consumption. It is because all the information was taken into account on the decision of the present consumption. What changes the amount of next period consumption is totally unexpected or not given information. Therefore, the changes in the consumption cannot be expected but randomly walk.

Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant

 
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or Islamic State, is a Sunni jihadist militant group. It operates in Libya, Nigeria, Iraq, and Syria. It is influenced by the Wahhabi version of Islam. It claims the status of independent state for the territories under its control in Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Syria. It is opposed to Shiism and has been described as "Shiaphobic". 
The group was started in the early years of the Iraq War and associated itself with al-Qaeda in 2004. ISIL was composed of different insurgent groups. Its aim was to establish a caliphate in the Sunni majority regions of Iraq, later expanding this to include Syria. In February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with ISIL.
ISIL is millenarianist, meaning it believes that society is going to change a lot over the course of 1,000 years.
Fighting.
At the height of the Iraq War, ISIL was in the Iraqi provinces of Al Anbar, Ninawa, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad. It claimed Baqubah as its capital. In the ongoing Syrian Civil War, the group has a large presence in the Syrian governorates of Ar-Raqqa, Idlib and Aleppo.
The group has attacked government and military targets. It has claimed responsibility for attacks that killed thousands of Iraqi civilians. During the time coalition forces were present in Iraq, the group suffered some setbacks. By 2012, it was thought to have regained most of its strength and more than doubled the number of its members to about 2,500.
In 2013, a letter and an audio recording of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was leaked to Al Jazeera. In it, al-Zawahiri disbanded the Syrian faction of ISIL. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, opposed this ruling on the basis of Islamic law. The group has since continued to operate in Syria. Starting in April 2013, it made rapid military gains in large parts of Northern Syria, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described them as "the strongest group". They have sought publicity by releasing videos of the decapitation (beheading) of journalists and other prisoners of war.
Worldwide Caliphate.
In June 2014, it announced a worldwide caliphate. In 2014, ISIL successfully fought in a large-scale offensive in Iraq. After this offensive, ISIL is reported to have seized control of most of Mosul, the second biggest city in Iraq, its surrounding Nineveh province, and the city of Fallujah. ISIL has also taken control of Tikrit, the administrative center of the Salah ad Din Governorate. It wants to capture Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
Film.
The 2014 film "The Blue Man", which is related to The New York Times article titled "Uncovering Iraq's Horrors in Desert Graves" written by John F. Burns, also mentions mass killings of Shia Muslims by the Islamic State between 2003 to 2006.

The Orpheum is a theatre and music venue. It is located on 884 Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Orpheum is a part of the Vancouver Civic Theatres group of live performance venues along with the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and Vancouver Playhouse. It was opened on November 7, 1927 as a vaudeville house although they had their first show the day before. When it opened in 1927, The Orpheum was the biggest theatre in Canada, had three thousand seats and cost $1.25 million to build. When vaudeville was slowing down from its popularity, the Orpheum found new owners in Famous Players and became mainly a movie house but hosted live events every now and then.
In 1973, Famous Players wanted to turn the place into a multiplex because of economic reasons. There was a "Save the Orpheum" public protest that was launched, which Jack Benny flew in to help with. The Orpheum was then saved.
It is the home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The Orpheum was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on November 15, 1979.

The price of a multiroom is usually between 10,000-15,000 won per hour. The room usually comes with unlimited snack and beverage refills. The snacks include pretzels, toast, ice cream, cereal and the beverages include coffee, soda, tea, and etc. Customers are allowed to bring the snacks into their cozy, small rooms and enjoy while singing or gaming. It is a trend in Korea for teenagers to go to multibangs or multirooms. This is because of the reasonable prices and it comes with many activities. Compared to going to noraebang, theaters or game rooms individually, multiroom is much more cheaper and reasonable. So for broke teenagers, it is a very attractive place to hang out.

Toussaint L'ouverture

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Toussaint L'Ouverture, François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture, also Toussaint Bréda, nicknamed "The Black Napoleon", was born on the 20th of May 1743. He was the leader of the Haitian Revolution. 
Toussaint L’Ouverture started his military career as a leader of the 1791 slave rebellion in Saint-Domingue, which was a French colony. When he did this he was a free black man. Toussaint gradually took the control over the whole island (also the Spanish part called Santo Domingo). When he had the power for years, he tried to improve the security and economy on saint-Domingue. He also restored the plantation system, by using paid labour. Besides of all this, he had a very large army.
Early life.
Little is known for sure about Toussaint L’Ouverture’s early life, because the sources disagree. The first records of his life were from his son, Isaac L’Ouverture. Most historic resources say Toussaint’s father was Gaou Guinou, who was a son of king Arrada. King Arrada was the king of what is Benin nowadays. His mother was Gaou Guinou’s second wife. 
Most sources tell us that Toussaint L’Ouverture was born on the plantation of Bréda at Haute de Cap in Saint Domingue. His birthdate is unknown, but All Saints' Day is likely, because his name says so. When the Haitian revolution started he was probably about 50 years old. Different sources give birth dates from 1739 until 1746. When he was a child he was small and weak, but he was to become known by his great stamina and horse-riding skills.
Education.
Most sources tell us that Toussaint was well educated by his godfather Pierre Baptiste. A few surviving documents show that he could write. 
Marriage and children.
Toussaint married Suzanne Simone Baptiste in 1782. Suzanne was probably his cousin. People think that he had 16 children, of whom 11 had already died before he did himself. His eldest (calmest) son was adopted. The two sons born out of his marriage with Suzanne were Isaac and Saint-Jean.
Slavery, freedom and working life.
Toussaint was known for being a slave until the start of the revolution. He was free at the age of 33.
When he was free, he became wealthier and began to have more property. He gathered a good fortune in the revolution and he was the owner of some properties. 
Religion and spirituality.
During his life Toussaint L’Ouverture was considered to be a Roman Catholic. The Vodou spirituality was also often used on the Bréda plantation. It was combined with Catholicism. It is not known if Toussaint had anything to do with these religions and spiritualties. When he was the ruler of Saint-Domingue, he said he did not.
Historians suggest he was a member of the high degree of the Masonic Lodge of Saint-Domingue. The historians thought this, because he used a Masonic symbol in his signature. The membership of free black people and white men has been confirmed.
Haitian revolution.
Saint-Domingue was the world biggest sugar producer and provided sugar for many countries. It had more than 800 sugar plantations. With a few rich families and 500,000 African slaves on Haiti, the slaves totally outnumbered everyone else. To stop the slaves from revolting and taking the power, the French people used terrible methods to keep the slaves powerless.
The Haitian Revolution began when the French people who owned the plantations wanted independence. But the slaves wanted something else; they wanted freedom. In 1791, about 100,00 slaves revolted. They burned all the sugar cane in the fields and killed hundreds of slave owners. In this early stage, Toussaint L’Ouverture did not join yet. But after some weeks, he took his family to the Spanish colony Santo Domingo to keep them safe and helped the supervisors of the plantation of Bréda to leave the island. If we believe surviving documents, 
Toussaint L’Ouverture was one of the leaders of the rebellion. He took part in discussing strategies and had contact with the Spanish people who supported the rebellion, because they provided food to the slaves who were in revolt. In 1801 he moved to Santo Domingo and took control of the territory, he freed the slaves and made Santo Domingo a constitution. 
When Napoleon Bonaparte seized the power in France, he took the rich sugar plantations on Saint-Domingue back. In January of the year 1602, French troops landed in Saint-Domingue in order to get rid of Toussaint L’Ouverture. When Napoleon Bonaparte told Toussaint that he wanted Saint-Domingue back, Toussaint said that he would get it back if he would end slavery on Saint-Domingue forever. Napoleon agreed and took Toussaint with him to Paris to discuss the deal further.
Despite the deal, the French people later accused him for planning another revolt against the plantation owners and he was sent to a cold jail in the French Alps. It was called Fort-de-Joux. Ten months after he was sent to jail, on the 7th of April 1803, the Haitian leader, Toussaint L’Ouverture died.
After his death the slavery on Haiti was restored, but is was never to be the same again. Toussaint had left an impression about the slavery and the slaves continued to fight the French rich plantation owners in a brutal way, which resulted in another revolution. Toussaint’s general took up his job in the revolution after he died. He was called Jean-Jacques Dessalines and he was the first Emperor of Haiti. Later in the revolt he was attacked and he died. 
But before he died the yellow fever on Haiti killed thousands of French people trying to calm the revolt down. On January 1, 1804, Saint-Domingue was renamed Haiti and was declared independent by Dessalines. In this way Haiti became the first black republic in the world and the colony to free itself from European rule.

Mary Sheldon Barnes

Mary Downing Sheldon (born September 15, 1850-died August 27, 1898) was a historian and teacher from the United States. She taught her students how to use primary sources and problem-solving to do their research in college. Anna Strunsky was inspired by Sheldon's work.
Early life.
Mary Downing Sheldon was born in Oswego, New York. She had four siblings. She was the oldest of them all. Her mother was named Frances Stiles. Her father was Edward Austin Sheldon. Her father founded Oswego State Normal and Training School. Sheldon would go to school there. She graduated in 1869. She worked there as a teacher for two years. She then went to school at the University of Michigan. She graduated in 1876 with a degree in classics. She went back to Oswego State Normal and Training School where she taught for two years. She taught history, Latin, botany, and Greek. She stopped work at Oswego and started working at Wellesley College in 1876. She worked there for two and a half years. She used case methods in her teaching. She quit working there in 1879 because she was sick and also had problems with the people who worked there. After she quit, she relaxed so she would feel better, and then traveled for fun. In 1882, she went back to work at Oswego. She wrote a book while she was there, called "Studies in General History". It was published in 1885.
Teaching and writing career.
On August 6, 1885, Sheldon got married. She married a man named Earl Barnes. She met him when he was a student of hers, and he was 11 years younger than her. He became the head of the education department at Stanford University in 1981. Sheldon moved with him and also worked at Stanford. She researched and taught classes about the History of Europe and the Pacific Slope areas. Sheldon and Barnes wrote a book together in 1891. It was called "Studies in American History." They also wrote another book in 1896, together. She wrote another book of her own, too. It was called "Studies of Historical Method," and taught readers about historical method. In 1897, Sheldon and Barnes quit working at Stanford. They traveled to Europe and wrote while they were there.
Death and afterwards.
On August 27, 1898, Sheldon died of heart disease in London. The teaching and writing that she did about research and historical method is considered ahead of its time. The work that she did helped improve history textbooks that are used today. In 1985 and 1986, papers, writings and other materials owned by Sheldon and Barnes were donated to the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College by Betty Barnes, the daughter-in-law of Earl Barnes, and his second wife, Anna Koehler Barnes.

Knott's Berry Farm

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Knott's Berry Farm is a theme park in Buena Park, California that is owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Since the theme park was purchased by Cedar Fair, the number of people who visited the park has increased. According to the 2013 Global Attractions Attendance Report, Knott's Berry Farm is the 13th most visited theme park in North America. The park has 40 rides, including roller coasters, family rides, children's rides, water rides, and historical rides, and there are plans to make the park bigger in the future.
The theme park sits on what used to be a berry farm that was built by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Starting around 1920, the family started selling berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along a highway. In 1934, the Knotts started selling fried chicken dinners inside a tea room that is on the farm. They later built shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. In 1940, Walter Knott built a ghost town on the farm, and added other attractions over many years. In 1968, Knott's Berry Farm started to charge people to visit the park. In 1983, the park added Camp Snoopy.
In the 1990s, the Knott children sold the family business after Walter and Cordelia Knott died. The theme park was sold to Cedar Fair and the food business was sold to ConAgra Foods, which was later sold to The J.M. Smucker Company.
Cedar Fair continued to make the park bigger in 1999 by adding Knott's Soak City. They also added more rides to Knott's Berry Farm.
History.
Origin.
The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a "summer-long county fair". In 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. On April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died, and Walter turned his attention toward political causes.
Sky Tower was built to support two attractions, the Parachute Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin. Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders looking forward to the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that is surrounded behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing view.. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is not allowed during the trip. During winds 25 mph+ or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction now held by nearby WindSeeker.) The illuminated "K" in logo script atop the Sky Tower was designated a landmark which prevented Knott's plan of changing the foundation to support WindSeeker.
Corkscrew debuted in 1975 as the first modern-day roller coaster to perform a 360-degree inverting element, twice. It was designed by Arrow Development. Corkscrew is still operating to this day, but was sold and moved in 1989 to Silverwood in Athol, Idaho. Montezooma's Revenge was later opened in 1978 and remains in operation at Knott's Berry Farm.

Leopoldo Galtieri

Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli (15 July 1926 – 12 January 2003) was an Argentine general and politician. He served as President of Argentina from 22 December 1981 to 18 June 1982. This was during the last military dictatorship (known officially as the National Reorganization Process). He was removed from power soon after the British retook the Falklands Islands, whose invasion he had ordered.
Born in the Buenos Aires area, Galtieri studied engineering while in the Argentine Army. A skilled engineer, he rose quickly through the ranks of the Argentine military. In 1975 he became the head of the Engineering Corps of the army. When Jorge Rafael Videla seized power a year later, Galtieri supported him. Videla was a brutal dictator and thousands of people were murdered under his rule. In 1981, Videla stepped down and Galtieri assumed power late that year after removing Roberto Viola in a coup d'état. Although not as brutal as Videla, he continued the "Dirty War."
The United States supported Galtieri. A strong anti communist, they saw Argentina as an ally against the Soviet Union. Soon after he took power the Argentine economy was nearing total collapse. Inflation, the rate at which new money is put into the economy, was as high as 130%. Unemployment was very high, and the state oil company lost six billion dollars in a matter of months, which remains the largest corporate loss in history. Galtieri allowed more dissent than the leaders who came before him, and protests against the dictatorship became common.
By 1982, Galtieri's popularity was relatively low and he wanted to boost his support and Argentine patriotism. Argentina had long claimed the Falkland Islands, a British territory. The British did not see Argentina as a war threat, and didn't heavily defend the islands. Jorge Anaya, one of the other members of the junta, or military council, who was often thought to be the most fanatical of the group and Galtieri thought of a plan to use force and violence to get the islands. Galtieri ordered an invasion by the Argentine military. After bombarding the capitol, Port Stanley, Argentina forced the British Governor of the islands, Rex Hunt, to surrender.
Galtieri became very popular after the invasion and huge rallies were held in Buenos Aires. His regime seemed to be very strong. But Galtieri had badly misread what British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would do. He also believed he would have the support of the United States. The US (and most of the world) supported Britain. The British sent their armed forces to the islands. After heavy fighting, the British defeated Argentina in June. Within days, the army turned on Galtieri and he was removed from power.
Afterwards, he was put on trial for crimes against humanity. Although one report wanted him to be executed, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In 1989 he was pardoned. He lived in a suburb of Buenos Aires. Never a rich man, he lived modestly for the rest of his life. Galtieri died from a heart attack caused by surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his pancreas. He was 76 years old. Widely viewed as a very incompetent dictator, he is often blamed for the defeat of Argentina in the Falklands War.

Districts were the second tier of local government introduced by the Local Government Act 1972, being subdivisions of the eight counties introduced at the same time. This system of two-tier local government was abolished in 1996 and replaced with the current system of unitary principal areas.
Each district was administered by an elected district council. The council was entitled to petition for a charter granting borough status, whereupon the district became a "borough" and the district council a "borough council" headed by a mayor. In addition, a district could be granted Letters Patent granting city status.

Gendarmerie Nationale

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
In France, the National Gendarmerie is one of the divisions of the French Armed Forces, the military police. They are responsible for the public safety. They act like police for the citizens of France. It also contains a military police force and a special forces component, the GIGN. In 2011 more than 98,155 people were working for the National Gendarmerie in France.
What do they do?
The Gendarmerie works together with the other national law enforcement agency, the Police Nationale. And since 2009, even though this force is a part of the armed forces establishment, it belonged to the Ministry of the Interior as its military component and it is part of its operations and the budget. They fulfill national security duties and duties in support of their ministry. 
They are also responsible for road patrols. The police can stop drivers. When they do so, it is called a contrôle. They can ask for a driver's identification papers and car papers at any time. 
Their weapon quote is Gendarmerie, une force humaine. This literally means "Gendarmerie, a human armed force."
Uniforms and armor.
The name "Gendarmerie" comes from "gens d’arme," which means "armed people." This military corp has an exploding grenade as its logo. Instead of metal medals, Gendarmes wear ribbons. These are called bâtons. They get ribbons, inter alia, for service abroad. 
Since a few years ago, the Gendarmes' flat hat, called a képi, has only been used for special occasions. 
The French did not have a uniform until the late 17th century, though some companies had recognizable coat colors. Light grey was common, but red and blue were also worn. It was said that the French in the 17th century had an addiction to bows, ribbons, and plumes, which was suitable to the future leaders of European fashion. Guard Gendarmes probably had red coats. Many guard troops wore the royal badge on their back and their breast. In the 16th century, national signs were that they wore a white cross on their back and on their breast. In the 17th century this became a white sash. 
Nowadays the Gendarmerie uses bulletproof and tactical vests and body armour. A anti-riot shield is used during a heavier riot. They also make use of the spectra helmet. This spectra helmet is fitted with a visor for extra protection of the face. If a tear gas is used, the operators use a special gas mask, which protects them from the dangerous gasses. They also have apparatus for throwing tear gas canisters and FAMAS riffles. This is a sort of weapon. This equipment helps protect Gendarmes while they are doing their jobs.
Departments.
"Departmental Gendarmerie".
This is the territorial police branch of the Gendarmerie. It is the branch that is most similar to France’s common police. It has regular contact with France’s population and does jobs similar to the Police of France. The Departmental Gendarmerie is divided into Brigades consisting of 6 to 40 operators. A brigade performs observation and may give assistance to citizens in regulated periods, during both daytime and nighttime.
"Mobile Gendarmerie".
The Mobile Gendarmerie has several tasks, which include riot control, security of significant places (like embassies), conducting OPEX (External Operations), and providing support to the Departmental Gendarmerie. It is divided into 25 legions, including one advanced armoured anti-riot police group. The Mobile Gendarmerie has control over the GIGN, the counter-terrorism part of the Gendarmerie Nationale.
"GIGN (National Gendarmerie Intervention Group)".
The GIGN members are well trained to conduct special operations such as hostage rescue. They are also trained in maritime anti-terrorism operations. They are trained to conduct operations with no risk to the public and the hostages. 
"Republican Guard".
A ceremonial unit that takes part in parades and secures important locations in a formal way.
"Maritime Gendarmerie".
Supervised by the Gendarmerie and the French Navy, the Maritime Gendarmerie conducts maritime surveillance, assistance and rescue at sea; police security at naval bases; and police at sea. They do these jobs not only in France, but also in other countries like French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and others.
"Air transport Gendarmerie".
The air transport gendarmerie is similar to the Gendarmerie de L’air. The Gendarmerie de L’air conducts safety operations in air force bases and goes to accidents involving military aircraft. Its missions include securing civilian airports, surveillance of technical things in the airport (like control towers), traffic control on the roads near airports, and making sure that important visitors are safe and well protected at airports.

Fishing reel

A fishing reel is a device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and unwinding fishing line. 
Modern fishing reels are designed to help in casting for distance and accuracy. Reels also retrieve line, usually with a handle. Fishing reels are traditionally used in the recreational sport of angling. They are also used in the sport of competitive casting. Reels are usually attached to a fishing rod by some means. However specialized reels are made to be mounted directly to the boat gunwales or transoms. 
The first writing describing a fishing reel is from about 1100 years ago in China. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 AD. By the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising gear-retrieved reels. An American watchmaker and inventor, George W. Snyder, invented the first gear multiplying reel abut 1810.

Triangular gimbap

Triangular gimbap (Korean: 삼각김밥 
 
 is a kind of gimbap. It is made from steamed white rice (bap) and various other ingredients. It is wrapped by gim (sheets of dried laver seaweed) in a triangle shape. The plastic wrapping is folded between the gim and rice. People can make it by themselves but usually they purchase it at a convenience store. They tend to eat it to replace their meals. A refrigerator shelf life is within 1 day. Convenience stores have various kinds of triangular gimbap. The price range is from 700 won to 900 won.
History.
Triangular gimbap was first made in Japan. At first, the name was Onigiri. It was ball-shaped and made to serve quick meals during war. Triangular gimbap was introduced to Korea during the 1990s. In 1991, 7-Eleven began to sell it. Family Mart and GS25 followed it. Nowadays, there are various flavors and types of triangular gimbap: tuna with mayonnaise, Jeonju bibimbap, bulgogi, spicy tuna, cheese spicy chicken, and so on.
Flaws.
Triangular gimbap is very convenient. It is easy to replace meals with it. However, it has a few side effects that are harmful to people's health. The amount of sodium and fat it contains is near the Daily Reference Value. The nutrients it contains are 20~30% of the amount a person needs to take a day. Also, synthetic preservative was found. It was revealed that several food additives are added to it because the main resource, rice, is at least 2-3 years old and manufacturers added artificial flavor enhancer to remove rice smell and bleach to make the rice whiter.

<doc id="454495" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454495" title="Casting (fishing)">
Casting (fishing)

In fishing, casting is the act of throwing bait or a lure using a fishing rod, reel, and line. Several types of rod and reels are designed just for casting. The method of casting can vary but in each case the object of casting is to get the bait or lure to where the fish are. 
Basic methods.
The most accurate type of cast is the 'overhead cast'. The angler raises the rod (and reel) back behind the head, then quickly flicks the rod forward, releasing the line as the cast is completed. The 'side cast' is less forceful but easier to learn. The rod is swung back in a horizontal motion then quickly moved forward releasing the line. Both basic methods have variations. But both are popular when using spinning and casting rods. Fly fishing uses similar movements, but the line release is different. All types of rods and reels need to match the weight rating of the rod, reel, line and lure for best performance. 
Spinning rods & reels.
Anyone can learn to cast a lure with a spinning rod and reel in just a few minutes. Two types of spinning reels, open faced and close faced. They work differently. With a closed face reel a push-button his held down and released at the end of the cast. Open face reels require the angler to first open the bail, then hold and release the line with your forefinger as you cast. Open faced reels have a disadvantage when casting short distances. Short casts causes the line to twist. This in turn causes line tangles on the spool. Spinning rods and reels work best using light line and light lures. Spinning reels have an advantage over casting reels when casting into the wind.
Bait casting rods & reels.
Bait casting (also called "baitcasting") reels come in different sizes and capacities. Depending on use, they also can have different features. The common feature is a horizontal spool that the line winds onto. Casting reels usually have better control of the line and lure. They have better accuracy than other types. Bait casting reels are better at handling heavier line and lures. But there is a to become skilled with a bait casting rod and reel. To cast a bait casting reel, a push-button is pressed and held until you want to release the line. Bait casting reels have a tendency to 'snarl' or 'backlash'. This is because during the cast the line is coming off the reel at a high rate of speed. When the lure hits the water the line stops. But the spool on the reel keeps turning, causing the line to snarl up. This is even more so when casting into the wind. Practice with bait casting reels minimizes this problem. To control snarling, bait casting reels usually have a brake. This automatically stops the spool when the line stops. Reels have either a magnetic brake control or a centrifugal brake control. Some have both. These must be adjusted to balance between good distance in casting and preventing backlash. Many anglers set the brake lightly to allow more distance. Then they control the braking with their thumb on the spool. Low-profile bait casting reels are designed especially for using the thumb.
Flipping and pitching.
Among the specialized types of casts with a bait casting rod are two made popular by tournament fishermen:
In both methods, the rod is used to swing the lure (like a pendulum) out over the water. In both cases the lure enters the water very quietly and so as not to frighten the fish.

Fly rods & reels.
Fly fishermen use artificial flies as a lure. Most flies have almost no weight and by themselves could not be cast with other types of rods and reels. The fly rod works because it uses a much heavier line than the other types. It is the line that is being cast. The fly simply goes where the line goes. Fly casting looks more difficult than it is. In less than a couple of hours most beginners can learn the basic cast. Fly casting is more involved than other types of casting. There are fly fishing schools that teach fly casting. 
To cast a fly rod, the angler pulls several feet of line off the reel. The rod tip is moved back then in a fluid motion and accelerating, it is moved forward as the line is released. In fishing streams and rivers, trees and shrubs on the bank may prevent an overhead cast. Another type of cast is the 'roll cast'. Using the rod tip the fisherman forces the rod tip down to roll the line forward. Most fly lines are rated by a weight system. A 1wt (one weight) is very light while a 13wt is very heavy. It would be suitable for large salt water fish. Rods (and reels) are rated by the weight of the line they are designed for. Unfortunately there is no one size for all kinds of fish and fishing situations.
Net casting.
The term may also be used for casting a net. The net is cast (thrown) by hand so that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught in the net and it is hauled back in. Net casting is often used to catch fish for bait. Modern cast nets have a radius of from 4 to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.6 metres). A larger net full of fish may take more than one person to pull it in. Cast nets also sometimes use a 'net thrower' device. This helps spin the net as its thrown, keeping it open. Cast nets work best in shallow water.
Competitive casting.
Casting (known as Casting Sport) is also a sport. The sport is supervised by the (ICSF). As of April 2014 are in 31 countries.
Casting competitions were active in England and the United States in the later 1800s. In 1881 the first tournament was held just outside of London. In 1955, 14 different national associations started the ICF (now ICSF). The ICSF sets all international standards for the sport. It sponsors tournaments. It also recognizes world records for accuracy and distance. This sport uses plastic weights or hookless flies. Competitions can be held on water or on athletic fields. There are competitive divisions for almost all types of fly, fixed spool and revolving spool tackle, and competitor classes. Competitive casting is part of the World Games.
World Championship in 2014 are to be held in Szamotuly (Poland), from 3 to 7 September.
