Frankenstein's monster

Frankenstein’s monster is a fictional character from Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus". He is created by another character in the novel called Victor Frankenstein. The creature is often called “Frankenstein” in popular culture, but in the novel he has no name. The monster is also called "creature", "monster", "fiend", "wretch", "vile insect", "daemon", "being", and "it".
In the novel, Victor creates the human-like monster in the upstairs room of his apartment at the University of Ingolstadt. He creates it by putting together body parts from graveyards and butcher shops. He uses a method that is not clearly explained involving chemistry and galvanism to make the creature come alive. Victor leaves the creature in horror the minute it is awake. It leaves his apartment in the middle of the night. 
Appearance.
In the novel, the monster looks as though:
Error: No text given for quotation (or equals sign used in the actual argument to an unnamed parameter)
He is 8 feet tall because Victor believed that it would be easier to make a human body if all the body parts were bigger. In popular media and culture, he is shown with green skin. In the novel, his skin is actually more of a yellow hue. The green portrayal of the creature with electricity bolts in his neck came from Boris Karloff’s movie portrayal of the monster.
Personality.
In the beginning, Frankenstein’s monster is like a baby. He is unable to talk. He discovers the world through sensing and observing. The monster develops understanding of simple things such as temperatures of hot and cold, sounds of birds chirping, and the differences between the sun and the moon. He eats roots, nuts, and berries when he is hungry. He finds a coat and some books while out in the wilderness.
He is described as sensitive, emotional, intelligent, prone to anger and violence, and very good at speaking. He learns how to speak from a family that he observes. He teaches himself how to read the books that he found. He has a severe sense of rejection from Victor and from every human he encounters. He has bad experiences with people. That makes him feel as though he is hated and unwanted. He resents humans and even feels hateful towards them because of how he has been treated. As a response, he kills several people, including Victor's younger brother William, Victor's best friend Henry Clerval, and later Victor's wife Elizabeth Lavenza.
Many movie adaptations have him mute and like a child instead of being intelligent. 
Relationship with Victor.
The creature has a complex relationship with Victor. He was rejected by Victor in the beginning, but he still wants to have a “father-like” figure. Victor is the only real human connection that the monster has. He demands that Victor take responsibility for his happiness.
In the novel, the creature refers to himself as “Adam”. This makes Victor a sort of God-like figure. 
After the monster learns how to read and speak, he goes on a journey to find Victor. He meets him in the mountains and tells him his story. After telling Victor about his difficult journey, he asks Victor to make a female monster for him so that he does not have to be alone anymore.

Tabassum Adnan

Tabassum Adnan (Urdu: تبسم عدنان) (born 1977) is a women's rights activist from Pakistan. In 2015, she won the U.S. State Department's International Women of Courage Award because of her work for justice for Pakistani women.
Life.
Tabassum Adnan was born in 1977. She grew up in the Swat Valley of Pakistan.
Tabassum was married when she was 13 years old. She had four children. She was a victim of domestic violence. After she was married for 20 years, she divorced her husband. 
The jirga for women.
Tabassum did not have a home or money, so she went to a local group for women. The group gave her the idea to work for more participation for women. First, she went to the Swat Qaumi Aman Jirga, a group with only men, but they refused her. A jirga is an informal court that enforces "qisas" (retribution laws). It is not a formal court, but many times the formal courts will listen to their decisions. 
In May 2013, Adnan started her own jirga. It was the first women's jirga in Pakistan. 
In Pakistan, women are used as chattel, or property, to settle disagreements between men. They are traded in marriage to pay debts and claims of honor, and to pay for crimes. Because women have little power, Adnan knew that her group needed to get the police and the courts to act. Her jirga has 25 women. It works to pressure the police and the traditional court system, and it gives legal help to the victims. The "Khwendo Jirga", or Sister’s Council also works for free education for girls, good health for women and girls, training in both home skills and work skills, loans for small business, and voting. The jirga also works for laws to stop violence against women, especially honor killings, dowry harassments, acid attacks, and torture. 
At first, the men's jirgas did not like the "Khwendo Jirga". Women's rights activists did not like it either. Then, in 2014, that changed. A child was raped, and the authorities did nothing. "Khwendo Jirga" had a protest walk, to attract the attention of the public. The police made arrests. Then, for the first time in Pashtun history, a woman, Adnan, was asked to sit on the men's jirga and help decide the case. After the first protest, the women had more success. In July, 2014, Adnan and Khwendo Jirga worked to pass a law against child marriage. Although some religious groups were not happy, the Sindh Assembly passed a law against marriages for anyone under the age of eighteen. In December, 2014 the Punjab Assembly voted to change the present law.

Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology

Coordinates: 
The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology in London is part of University College London Museums & Collections. With over 80,000 objects, it is one of the world's best collections of objects from Egypt and the Sudan. 
History.
The museum started in 1892 to help with the teaching of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology. The collection began with objects given to the museum by the writer Amelia Edwards. William Flinders Petrie led many important archaeological digs. In 1913 he sold his collection to University College. He had found objects at major sites, such as the Roman Period cemeteries at Hawara. These were famous for the beautiful mummy portraits in classical Roman style. He found objects at Amarna, the city of king Akhenaten, the first king to believe in one God. At Meydum, the site of the first true pyramid Petrie found some of the earliest examples of mummification.
The collection and library were in rooms at the university. A book about the collection was printed in 1915. At first the museum was only for people studying and not open to the public. After Petrie retired in 1933, other archaeologists added objects to the collection. These had been found in other parts of Egypt and the Sudan. During the Second World War (1939–1945) the collection was packed up and moved out of London for to keep it safe. In the early 1950s it was moved into an old stable, beside the science library.
Collections.
The museum has one of the oldest pieces of linen from Egypt, made about 5000 BC. There are two lions from the temple of Min at Koptos. These were part of the first group of monumental sculpture from about 3000 BC. There is a small piece from the first king list or calendar written about 2900 BC. The museum has some iron beads, the earliest example of metal from Egypt. There is the earliest example of glazing. The collection includes the earliest 'cylinder seal' in Egypt made about 3500 BC. It also has a collection of writings on papyrus, which are the oldest wills, the oldest medical writing, the only veterinary writing from ancient Egypt; and the largest architectural drawing, showing a shrine (about 1300 BC).
The collection also includes a number of costumes. It has the 'oldest dress', there is a beadnet dress of a dancer from the Pyramid Age (about 2400 BC) and two long sleeved robes of the same date. There is a suit of armour from the palace of Memphis, as well as socks and sandals from the Roman period. The collection contains works of art from Akhenaten’s city at Amarna. There are: colourful tiles, carvings and frescoes, from Egyptian and Nubian settlements and burial sites. The museum has the world’s largest collection of Roman period mummy portraits. These were made in the first to second centuries AD. The collection also includes objects from the Coptic and Islamic periods.
The museum.
The museum has three rooms. The main room has many of the museum's small objects, as well as tablets of writing, mummy portraits and cases. The first room has mainly pottery. Some parts of the collection are not lit to protect the objects from light and visitors use torches to see inside the cases.
The collection has been digitised and the catalogue can be viewed online.

<doc id="504092" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504092" title="Automeris io">
Automeris io

Automeris io is the North American Io moth. It has anti-predator defences common in the Lepidoptera. The adults have a two-stage defence system: first they are cryptic with their wings closed. If predators get too near, they flash their vivid eye markings. This startles the predator, and the moth has time to fly off and hide. The adults are nocturnal, they only fly at night, and during the day they sit on tree trunks or branches. 
Very widespread, the moth ranges from southern Canada to Mexico and Costa Rica. In between, it is found widely in the USA.
Life cycle.
Adults.
They do not eat, and live only about a week: all they do is reproduce. This is typical of Saturniid moths. They have sexual dimorphism as can be seen from the illustrations, and fly at night. The females come out of the cocoon with ready-made eggs, and the males pick up the female pheromones with their extra-big antennae.
Caterpillars.
The caterpillars live together (are gregarious), and travel in single file all over the food plant. They start off orange in colour, and eventually turn bright green. As they grow in size they become covered with stinging spines. The spines deliver a very painful venom which is released at the slightest touch.

Socks (cat)

Socks Clinton (1989 – February 20, 2009) was the pet cat of U.S. President Bill Clinton and his family while he was in the White House.
Socks was an adopted stray cat and the only pet of the Clintons during the first years of Clinton's presidency. A picture of Socks was always on the children's White House website. After Clinton left office, Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie and her husband. This was because Socks fought a lot with the Clinton family dog Buddy. Socks never got along with the dog.
Biography.
Socks became the pet cat of the Clintons in 1991 after he jumped into Chelsea Clinton's arms at her piano teacher's home in Little Rock, Arkansas. Socks was playing with his sibling, Midnight, who was later adopted by another family.
When Bill Clinton became President, Socks moved with the family from the governor's mansion in Arkansas to the White House. Even though he was the official 'first pet', he shared his food and water with a stray tabby cat, named Slippers. Socks was often taken to schools and hospitals to visit. Children visiting the White House website would be shown around by a cartoon version of Socks.
In December 2002, Socks was part of the Little Rock, Arkansas Christmas parade.
Buddy.
Things changed for the worse for Socks in 1997. The Clintons got a pet dog named Buddy, a Labrador Retriever. Socks hated this dog. Hillary Clinton said Socks "despised Buddy from first sight, instantly and forever." Bill Clinton said, "I did better with ... the Palestinians and the Israelis than I've done with Socks and Buddy." When the Clintons left the White House in 2001, they took Buddy to their new home, but left Socks with Betty Currie. Buddy died within a year, being hit by a car in 2002.
Later life and death.
In June 2008, Socks was still living with Currie and her husband in Hollywood, Maryland, about 60 miles from Washington. But Socks was losing weight and losing his fur. In December 2008, Socks was again reported to be in failing health from cancer. Socks was euthanized on February 20, 2009, in Hollywood, Maryland. He had cancer in his jaw.
Letters written to Socks.
First Lady Hillary Clinton wrote a children's book called "Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets" in 1998. It included more than 50 letters written to the First Pets by children. It had more than 80 photos of Socks and Buddy.
A Republican Representative in the United States Congress, Dan Burton once argued against the use of White House employees, postage, and stationery being used to answer mail that was written to the cat.

Egyptian chronology

Egyptian chronology is the study of events in ancient Egypt, and trying to date to when they took place. There is a general agreement about this chronology among Egyptologists. The Old Kingdom began in the 27th century BC, the Middle Kingdom in the 21st century BC and the New Kingdom in the mid-16th century BC.
But there are details which are still being argued about. The dates for the Early Dynastic Period can vary by up to 300 years, up to 30 years in the New Kingdom, and a few years for the Late Period.
Some individual Egyptologists have come up with "alternative chronologies". For example the "New Chronology" proposed in the 1990s, changes the New Kingdom dates by 350 years, or the "Glasgow Chronology" (proposed 1978–1982), which changes the New Kingdom dates by 500 years.
Overview.
For more details, see List of pharaohs
Agreement about the general chronology used in Egyptology has not changed much over the last 100 years. For the Old Kingdom, there have been changes by as much as a few centuries. The Middle and New Kingdoms dates have only changed by a few decades. These changes can be seen by comparing the chronology of two Egyptologists, the first from 1906, the second in 2000 (all dates in the table are BC).
There are differences between the two sets of dates. This is because of new discoveries, and a better understanding of what is already known. For example, in Breasted's 1906 list, he added a ruler in the Twentieth dynasty that further research showed did not exist. Using Manetho writings, Breasted also believed each new dynasty followed the old one in a sequence. Now we know that several dynasties existed at the same time. These changes have changed the chronology by 400 years at the beginning of Dynasty I.
Regnal years.
The main way to work out the chronology is to use the ancient Egyptian lists of kings. The number of years each king ruled, regnal years, can be added up. However there are problems with these lists. Some, such as the "Turin King List", are quite detailed but they are not complete. The whole of "Abydos King List" has survived, but it does not have a complete list of rulers. Sometimes different versions of the same text are different. For example, Manetho's history of Egypt has not survived. Later writers such as Eusebius and Sextus Julius Africanus used Manetho's work for their histories, but their dates for the same ruler are often very different.
The dates for king's rule can be pieced together from inscriptions. These often give a date in the form of the regnal year of the ruling pharaoh. They may or may not include any coregencies with a predecessor or successor. Some Egyptian dynasties may have overlapped, with different pharaohs ruling in different regions at the same time. This may lead to widely different chronologies.
Egyptologists have two other ways to find the total number of years. For the Old Kingdom, they can use the number of cattle censuses. For later periods, they can use the celebration of a sed festival. In the Old Kingdom, there was a regular census where the number of cattle was counted. At first this was believed to have taken place every two years. There were 24 cattle censuses during the rule of Sneferu, who therefore ruled for 48 years. However new research has shown the census was sometimes held every year, or at gaps of more than two years. The sed festival was held on the 30th anniversary of the Pharaoh's rule. A ruler with one sed festival recorded would have ruled at least 30 years. However, this may not be the usual practice in all cases.
Linking to other events.
A useful way to work around these gaps in knowledge is to find links to other known events. This can lead to a precise date. A number of these have been found, although they are of varying degrees of usefulness and reliability.
Archeological sequences.
This is using archeaology to put events in order, or a sequence. This does not fix a person or event to a exact year. A series of events can provide evidence to provide or support a precise date. For example, a number of stone vessels of the rulers of the first two dynasties were placed in rooms under the Step Pyramid of Djoser. These were sealed off by during the building of the pyramid during the Third Dynasty. Another example are stone blocks from the Old Kingdom with the names of several kings. These stones were later used to build the Middle Kingdom pyramid-temples at Lisht. The third pylon at Karnak, built by Amenhotep III had "fill" material from the kiosk of Sesostris I, as well as stelae of the Second Intermediate Period and the Eighteenth Dynasty of the New Kingdom.
Other chronologies.
The chronologies of other cultures can be used to find links to Egypt. The most important are the Assyrian and Babylonian chronologies. Chronologies of the Hittites, ancient Palestine, and ancient Greece are also used. For example in the 18th century BC a stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu says that pharaoh Neferhotep I was ruled at the same time as kings Zimri-Lim of Mari and Hammurabi of Babylon. In the 15th century BC, during the Amarna Period, there are letters between the Egyptian Kings Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, and various Near Eastern monarchs. 
Inscriptions.
Inscriptions on objects often provides clues. The burial of Apis bulls began in the reign of Amenhotep III. The bulls were killed in a sacrifice and placed in tombs. The details of each bull were included, as well as details of the rulers. It is possible to estimate dates of regnal years using this information. The bulls were still being buried in Ptolemaic times. There is a significant gap in the record between Ramesses XI and the 23rd year of Osorkon II. Poor documentation of these finds in the Serapeum also makes it difficult to use these records.
Astronomy.
Astronomy can also provide clues for dates. The best known of these is the Sothic cycle. A study of this led Richard A. Parker to argue that the dates of the Twelfth dynasty could be fixed exactly. New research does not agree with some of the information used in to work out dates this way For example, Donald B. Redford, in attempting to fix the date of the end of the Eighteenth dynasty, did not use the Sothic evidence. Instead he used, links between Egypt and Assyria (by way of the Hittites), and help from astronomical observations.
Radiocarbon dating.
Radiocarbon dating is another way to work out dates. This is useful for the Early Dynastic period where other methods have dates as different as 400 years. A 2013 study put the start of the First Dynasty in the 32nd or 31st century. This matches other information which placed it in between the 34th and 30th centuries.
The Thera eruption.
The Thera eruption is a problem for both Egyptian and Aegean (Minoan) chronology. The radiocarbon date for the eruption is between 1627 and 1600 BC. The date used in archaeology is c. 1500 BC. This date is important in the study of the civilisations in the Eastern Mediterranean. Since 2012, there have been suggestions that the answer would be to change both dates towards a "compromise" date in the mid 16th century BC. As of 2014 the problem has not been satisfactorily resolved.
Dendrochronology.
Dendrochronology uses patterns found in tree growth rings to work out a date. It is possible to do this for Egyptian chronology. For example there is the Uluburun shipwreck from the New Kingdom. Using both dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating, tree rings can be dated as far back as the Middle Kingdom. This was used for the coffin of Ipi-ha-ishutef (dated 2073±9 BC) and the funerary boat of Senusret III (dated 1887±11 BC; conventional reign date 1878 BC–1839 BC).
Alternative chronologies.
A number different chronologies have been presented during the 20th century:

Daewoo Motors

Daewoo Motors was a South Korean automotive company owned by General Motors. The company started in 1937 as National motors in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon, South Korea. In 1965 it became Shinjin Motor after becoming affiliated with Toyota. In 1972 Toyota withdrew. The same year Shinjin became General Motors Korea, a joint venture with General Motors. The company was renamed Saehan Motors in 1976. In 1982 the company was bought by the Daewoo group. Daewoo was known for its affordable cars many of which were made in partnership with GM until the mid '90s. The Daewoo Group ran into financial trouble in the late 1990s. It was then put up for sale and acquired by General Motors in 2001. It was renamed GM Daewoo, and began to produce GM vehicles again including Chevrolet Aveo which is based on Daewoo's Kalos model. Many of GM Daewoo's cars were sold by long time partner Suzuki, until 2011 when Suzuki withdrew from GM. In 2011 GM renamed the company to GM Korea, and officially dropped the Daewoo name.

Trajan's Column

Trajan's Column is a Roman triumphal column in Rome, Italy. It was built to remember Roman emperor Trajan's victory in the Dacian Wars. It was probably built by the architect Apollodorus of Damascus at the order of the Roman Senate. It is in Trajan's Forum, near the Quirinal Hill, north of the Roman Forum. It was completed in AD 113. It has a spiral bas relief, which shows the wars between the Romans and Dacians (101–102 and 105–106). Its design has inspired numerous victory columns, both ancient and modern.
The column is about 30 metres (98 ft) in height, 35 metres (125 ft) including its large pedestal. It is made from a series of 20 hollow Carrara marble pieces. Each one weighs about 32 tons, with a diameter of 3.7 metres (11 ft). The 190-metre (625 ft) frieze winds around the column 23 times. Inside the column, a spiral staircase of 185 steps gives access to a viewing platform at the top. The capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of c. 34 m.
Ancient coins show plans to put a statue of an eagle on top of the column. However it was built with a statue of Trajan. This statue disappeared in the Middle Ages. On December 4, 1587, the top was crowned by Pope Sixtus V with a bronze figure of St. Peter. When it was built the column was next to two libraries, which perhaps held the soldier-emperor's account of the Roman-Dacian Wars.

Insurance Institute for Highway Safety

 
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) is a non-profit organization funded by at least 75 insurance companies. IIHS was started in 1959 with their headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Their goal is to reduce deaths, injuries and property loss from automobile es on US highways. It researches and rates popular passenger vehicles. IIHS also rates consumer products such as child safety seat. They also research road design and traffic regulations. 
It carries out research and produces ratings for popular passenger vehicles as well as for certain consumer products such as child safety seats. It also conducts research on road design and traffic regulations, and has been involved in promoting policy decisions. According to their own bylaws IIHS does not lobby the United States Congress and other lawmaking bodies to change laws. They educate lawmakers and by invitation.
History.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety was established by insurance companies in 1959 to advise other organizations about highway safety. In 1966 the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act was enacted by Congress. It set up what is now called the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 1968 when Richard Nixon became president, William Haddon, Jr., was replaced as head of the agency. He was hired by the IIHS to reorganize and set up a crash testing program. In the 1970s the IIHS was involved in the then controversial airbag standard. 
Automobile crash ratings.
Two organizations in the US perform destructive testing to establish crash test ratings. The other is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a government agency. Both test new cars and issue ratings, but the tests are different. They also use different rating systems. 
The NHTSA uses three tests. The first is a 35 mph frontal crash test. It determines what injuries a driver or passenger might experience in that type of accident. The second is a side-impact test (made up of two tests using different weights). The third test is not an actual test. It is a rating based on a mathematical formula based on the car's width and center of gravity. NHTSA uses a five star rating system. A single star is poor while five stars is the best rating. 
The IIHS uses five tests. They do two frontal tests. A small-overlap is set up with 25% of the front of the car hitting a barrier at 40 mph. A moderate overlap test allows more of the front of the car to hit the barrier. In a side-impact test a movable barrier hits the car side at 31 mph. A roof test involves a flat piece of metal pushed down against the roof to see at what point it collapsed. It is not an actual roll-over test. The last test is on the seats and head restraints. The IIHS classifies its rankings as Poor, Marginal, Acceptable or Good. 
IIHS also gives out two awards each year. They are "Top Safety Pick" and "Top Safety Pick+". Vehicles that have good results all five tests and have Collision avoidance systems win the top award. The Top Safety Pick award goes to vehicles that pass the five tests alone.
Unrated vehicles.
Not every model of car is tested. Both agencies test the most widely sold vehicles. Convertibles and other limited production cars are often not tested. In 2007 the IIHS did test 10 models. Test results often appear months after a car goes on sale. Both agencies buy their vehicles from [car dealership]]s. The IIHS has only begun to mention upcoming (to be tested) models while the NHTSA has noted this for some time.

Pack hunter

A pack hunter or social predator is a predator belonging to the animal kingdom, which has evolved to hunt its prey by working together with other members of its species. Normally animals hunting in this way are closely related. Except where only males normally hunt (humans and chimpanzees), all individuals in a family group will contribute to hunting. The most commonly known pack hunter is the gray wolf. The wolf is the closest wild relative of all breeds of domesticated dog. Humans and their closest-living relatives chimpanzees are also pack hunters. Other pack hunting mammals include dolphins, lions and spotted hyenas. A number of avian social predators exist. These include the Harris's hawk, butcherbirds, three of four kookaburra species and many helmetshrikes. There are a few cold-blooded pack hunters. Forexample, simple arthropods such as army ants. Another example is the yellow saddle goatfish Occasionally crocodiles are pack hunters. Hunting in packs allows smaller predators to hunt larger prey.

Abu Simbel temples

The Abu Simbel temples are two very large rock temples at Abu Simbel. This is a village in Nubia, southern Egypt, near the border with Sudan. The temples are on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about 230 km southwest of Aswan. They are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments." The temples were cut into solid rock in side of a cliff during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC. It was a lasting monument to himself and his queen Nefertari, to remember his victory at the Battle of Kadesh.
The complete temples were moved in 1968, to a place high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir. They would have been flooded by water from Lake Nasser which was formed by the building of a dam on the Nile River. 
History.
Construction.
Work on the temples began about 1264 BC and lasted for about 20 years. It was called the "Temple of Ramesses, beloved by Amun". It was one of six rock temples built in Nubia by Ramesses II. The temple was meant to impress Egypt's southern neighbours. It also helped to strengthen Egyptian religion in the area. Historians say that the design of Abu Simbel shows Ramesses II's ego and pride.
Rediscovery.
Over time people stopped using the temples which became covered with sand. In the 6th century BC, the sand covered the statues of the main temple up to their knees. The temple was forgotten until 1813, when Jean-Louis Burckhardt saw the top frieze of the main temple. He told Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, who went to the site, but was unable to dig out an entry to the temple. Belzoni went back in 1817, and was able to enter the temples. Details of the temples, with drawings, are in Edward William Lane's "Description of Egypt" (1825-1828).
Tour guides at the temples tell a story that "Abu Simbel" was a young local boy who took Burckhardt and Belzoni to see the buried temple. He had seen the temples from time to time in the shifting sands. Eventually, the temples were named after him.
Relocation.
In 1959 an international campaign was started to raise money to save the temples from being flooded by water from the new Aswan High Dam.
One plan put forward was to build a dam around the temples to keep the water at the same level as the river. It was thought that raising the temples would put them in danger of being eroded by the wind. This plan was rejected.
The moving of the temple began in 1964, with archaeologists, engineers and workers coming from all over the world as a UNESCO project. It cost $40 million at the time. Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was carefully cut into large blocks. Some blocks weighed up to 30 tons, with most around 20 tons. These blocks were lifted and put back together on a new site 65 meters higher, and 200 meters further back from the river.
This was one of the greatest challenges of archaeological engineering in history. Some parts had to be saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today hundreds of visitors come to the temples every day. Buses and cars leave twice a day from Aswan, the nearest city. Many visitors also come by plane, to an airfield that was specially built near the temples.
There are two temples. The larger one was built for the gods Ra-Harakhty, Ptah and Amun. It has four large statues of Ramesses II on the facade. The smaller temple was built for the goddess Hathor, who is shown as Nefertari, Ramesses's favourite of his many wives. The temple is open to the public.
The Great Temple.
The Great Temple at Abu Simbel took about 20 years to build. It was completed in the 24th year of the rule of Ramesses the Great (about 1265 BC). It was built for the gods Amun, Ra-Horakhty, and Ptah, as well as for Rameses himself, who was treated as a god. It is one the grandest and most beautiful temples from the time of Rameses II, and one of the most beautiful in Egypt.
The facade of the temple has four 20 meter tall statues of the pharaoh with the double Atef crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The facade is 35 meters wide. Across the top is a frieze with 22 baboons. The baboons have their hands raised to welcome the rising sun at dawn. These huge statues were carved into solid rock. All statues show Ramesses II, seated on a throne and wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The statue on the left of the entrance was damaged in an earthquake soon after it was built. The head and body are on the ground at the statue's feet.
Next to the legs of the large statue, there are others no higher than the knees of the pharaoh. These show Nefertari, Ramesses's chief wife, and queen mother Mut-Tuy, his first two sons Amun-her-khepeshef, Ramesses, and his first six daughters Bintanath, Baketmut, Nefertari, Meritamen, Nebettawy and Isetnofret.
Above the entrance is a bas-relief with two images of the king praising the falcon-headed Ra Harakhti. This god is holding the hieroglyph meaning "user" and a feather in his right hand, with Ma'at, the goddess of truth and justice, in his left. This is a really just a large puzzle with the answer being Ramesses II's throne name, User-Maat-Re. A stele on the facade records the marriage of Ramesses with a daughter of king Hattusili III, which sealed the peace between Egypt and the Hittites.
Like most Egyptian temples it has a triangle shaped layout inside. The rooms become smaller in size from the entrance to the sanctuary. The temple has a complicated and unusual structure with many side chambers. The hypostyle hall (sometimes also called a pronaos) is 18 meters long and 16.7 meters wide. It is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars. These show Ramesses as a god, with Osiris, the god of the Underworld. This shows the unending nature of the pharaoh. The big statues along the left-hand wall have the white crown of Upper Egypt, while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt (pschent). The bas-reliefs on the walls of the pronaos show battle scenes from Ramesses's many wars. They show the Battle of Kadesh, on the Orontes river, in present-day Syria, where Ramesses fought against the Hittites. The most famous image shows the king on his chariot shooting arrows against his enemies, who are being taken prisoner. Other scenes show Egyptian victories in Libya and Nubia.
From the hypostyle hall, one enters the second pillared hall. This has four pillars covered with beautiful scenes of offerings to the gods. Ramesses and Nefertari are seen with the sacred boats of Amun and Ra-Harakhti. This hall leads to another room which is the way in to the sanctuary. On a back wall are rock cut sculptures of four seated figures: Ra-Horakhty, Ramesses (as a god), and the gods Amun Ra and Ptah. Ra-Horakhty, Amun Ra and Ptah were the main gods during this time and their cult centers were at Heliopolis, Thebes and Memphis respectively.
The role of the sun.
It is believed that the temple was positioned so that on October 22 and February 22, light from the sun would reach the sanctuary. This would light up the sculptures on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, the god linked with the Underworld, who always remained in the dark. 
These dates could be the king's birthday and coronation day. However there is no evidence to support this. It makea sense that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the 30th anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. October 22 is 60 days before the solstice and February 20 is 60 days after the Solstice.
The image of the king would get energy from the sun, and Ramesses the Great could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty.
People gather at Abu Simbel to see this remarkable sight, on October 21 and February 21. The dates have changed by one day because of the movement of the Tropic of Cancer in the last 3280 years.
The Small Temple.
The Small Temple was built about 100 meters northeast of the Great Temple. It was built for the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II's favorite wife, Nefertari. The facade is cut into solid rock, with two groups of very large statues on either side of the large gateway. The statues, slightly more than ten meters high, are of the king and his queen. On the sides of the entrance are two statues of the king, one wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt and the other with double crown. On sides of these are statues of the queen and the king.
This is the only example in Egyptian art where the statues of the king and queen are equal size. Usually the statues of the queens stand next to those of the pharaoh, but were never taller than his knees. Ramesses went to Abu Simbel with his wife in the 24th year of his rule. There are small statues of princes and princesses next to their parents. On the south side they are (facing them from left to right), princes Meryatum and Meryre, princesses Meritamen and Henuttawy, and princes Rahirwenemef and Amun-her-khepeshef. On the north side the same figures are in reverse order. 
The plan of the Small Temple is a simple copy of the Great Temple. The hypostyle hall or pronaos is supported by six pillars. They show scenes with the queen playing the sinistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret. In one scene Ramesses is presenting flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars have the face of the goddess Hathor; known as a Hathoric column. The bas-reliefs in the hall show Ramesses becoming a god. There are scenes of the king (with his wife) defeating his enemies. Another scene shows the queen making offerings to the goddess Hathor and Mut. Three large doors open into another room. On the south and the north walls of this room there are scenes of the king and his wife giving papyrus plants to Hathor. Hathor is shown as a cow on a boat sailing through papyri plants. On the west wall, Ramesses II and Nefertari are shown making offerings to god Horus and the gods of the Cataracts — Satis, Anubis and Khnum. This room leads to the sanctuary and two side rooms.
The sanctuary has bas-reliefs on the side walls with scenes of offerings to various gods made either by the pharaoh or the queen. On the back wall, there is a niche in which Hathor, as a divine cow, seems to be coming out of the mountain. Queen Nefertari is closely linked to this goddess.
Priests.
Each temple has its own priest to represent the king in daily religious ceremonies. The Pharaoh should be the only celebrant in daily religious ceremonies performed in different temples throughout Egypt. In reality, the high priest also played that role. A priest, like the king, needed education in art and science. Reading, writing, engineering, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, space measurement, time calculations, were all part of this learning. The priests of Heliopolis, for example, became guardians of sacred knowledge and were seen as wise men.

<doc id="504319" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504319" title="Arch bridge">
Arch bridge

An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust held by the abutments at either side. A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches. However other less expensive structures are typically used today.
History.
The oldest existing arch bridge may be the Mycenaean Arkadiko bridge in Greece. It was built in about 1300 BC. The stone corbel arch bridge is still used. The well-preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge has a triangular corbel arch. The 4th century BC Rhodes Footbridge rests on an early voussoir arch. 
Both the Etruscans and ancient Greeks knew about arches. But the Romans were the first to use arches for bridge construction. 
Roman arch bridges were usually semicircular. A number were also segmental arch bridges (such as Alconétar Bridge), a bridge which has a curved arch that is less than a semicircle. The advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it. This would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods. Also the bridge itself could be more lightweight. Generally, Roman bridges had wedge-shaped primary arch stones (called voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts. Their bridges featured flood openings in the piers.
In medieval Europe, bridge builders improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers. They used thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios on bridges. Gothic pointed arches were also introduced reducing lateral thrust. In particular the 14th century saw bridge construction reaching new heights. Spans of up to 40 m were previously unheard of in masonry arch construction.
Simple compression arch bridges.
Advantages of simple materials.
Stone, brick and other similar materials are strong in compression. They are fairly strong in shear. But they cannot resist much force in tension. As a result, masonry arch bridges are designed to be constantly under compression. Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone in the middle of the bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. Masonry arch bridges use fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge. This also prevents tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. Unreinforced concrete was also used. When masonry (cut stone) is used, the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together. The mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.

Striped hyaena

The striped hyaena ("Hyaena hyaena") is a widespread small carnivore. It is native to North and East Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is listed by the IUCN as near threatened, and the global population may be under 10,000 mature individuals. It is persecuted, and its prey base is declining.
It is the smallest of its genus and has many primitive viverrid characteristics which are lost in the larger species. For example, it has a smaller and less specialised skull. 
It is mainly a scavenger, but large individuals may kill their own prey. Attacks on humans are rare, but do happen. The striped hyena is a monogamous animal, with both males and females assisting one another in raising their cubs. A nocturnal animal, the striped hyena only comes out in complete darkness, and is quick to return to its lair before sunrise. It has a habit of feigning death when attacked. It has also been known to stand its ground against larger predators such as leopards in disputes over food.
The striped hyaena features prominently in Middle Eastern and Asian folklore. It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, where it is referred to as "tzebua" or "zevoa", though the species is absent in some English translations.

Fossa

This page is about the animal with the common name fossa. For the taxonomic genus Fossa, see Malagasy civet.
The fossa ("Cryptoprocta ferox") is a cat-like, carnivorous mammal endemic to Madagascar. It is a member of the Eupleridae, a family of carnivorans closely related to the mongoose family (Herpestidae). 
Its classification has been controversial because it looks like a cat. However, other traits suggest a close relationship with viverrids (most civets and their relatives). Its classification influenced thought about how many times mammalian carnivores had colonized Madagascar. Genetic studies now show that the fossa and all other Malagasy carnivores are closely related to each other: they are a clade, the family Eupleridae. 
Carnivorans are now thought to have colonized the island once about 18 to 20 million years ago.
The fossa is the largest mammalian carnivore on the island of Madagascar and has been compared to a small cougar. Adults have a head-body length of 70 - and weigh between 5.5 and. The males larger than the females. It has semiretractable claws and flexible ankles that allow it to climb up and down trees head-first, and they can jump from tree to tree. 
The species is widespread, although population densities are usually low. It is found only in forested habitat, and hunts by day and night. Over 50% of its diet consists of lemurs, the endemic primates of the island. Tenrecs, rodents, lizards, birds, and other animals are also prey. Mating usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs and can last for several hours. Litters range from one to six pups, which are born blind and toothless (altricial). Infants wean after 4.5 months and are independent after a year. Sexual maturity occurs around three to four years of age, and life expectancy in captivity is 20 years. The fossa is listed as "Vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is generally feared by the Malagasy people and is often protected by their taboo. The greatest threat to the species is habitat destruction.

Ottoman architecture

Ottoman architecture is the architecture of the Ottoman Empire. It emerged in Bursa and Edirne in 14th and 15th centuries. The architecture of the empire developed from the earlier Seljuk architecture. It was influenced by the Byzantine, Iranian and Seljuk architecture. It was also influenced by Islamic Mamluk traditions after the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans. For almost 400 years Byzantine architectural artifacts such as the church of Hagia Sophia served as models for many of the Ottoman mosques. Overall, Ottoman architecture has been described as Ottoman architecture synthesized with architectural traditions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
The Ottomans achieved the highest level architecture in their lands. They mastered the technique of building vast inner spaces confined by seemingly weightless yet massive domes. Their work achieved harmony between inner and outer spaces, as well as light and shadow. Islamic religious building, which until then was simple but with extensive decoration, was transformed by the Ottomans. They used vaults, domes, semi-domes and columns. The mosque was changed from being a cramped and dark chamber with arabesque-covered walls into a beautiful sanctuary.

Seljuk architecture

Seljuk architecture is the name given to architecture built during the time when the Seljuks ruled most of the Middle East and Anatolia. This was between the 11th and 13th centuries. After the 11th century the Seljuks of Rum emerged from the Great Seljuk Empire developing their own architecture. Their capital was Konya. They were influenced and inspired by the Armenians, Byzantines and Persians.
Great Seljuq Empire architecture.
The architecture can be found in a vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush to eastern Anatolia. Also from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf. The homeland of Seljuk architecture was Turkmenistan and Iran. This is where the first permanent Seljuk buildings were built. Unfortunately the Mongol invasions destroyed most of these buildings. Only a few remain. In 1063 Isfahan was established as capital of the Great Seljuk Empire under Alp Arslan.
The most significant change was in the early 12th century. It was the conversion of the hypostyle plan into a four-iwan plan mosque (see Shah Mosque). Another mosque-type introduced at this time was the kiosk mosque, consisting of a domed space with three open sides and wall containing a mihrab on the qibla side. The architecture of this period was also characterized by memorial tombs. These were usually octagonal structures with domed roofs, called Kümbet or Türbe. An impressive example of tomb architecture is the mausoleum of Sultan Sanjar at Merv. It is a massive building measuring 27 m square with a huge double dome resting on squinches and muqarnas pendentives.

Palermo Stone

The Palermo Stone is one of seven pieces left of a much bigger stele known as the Royal Annals of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The stele has a list of the kings of Egypt from the First Dynasty through to the early part of the Fifth Dynasty. It also listed important events in each year of their rule. It was probably made during the Fifth Dynasty (about 2392–2283 BCE). The Palermo Stone is in the Antonio Salinas Regional Archaeological Museum in the city of Palermo, Italy, from which it gets its name.
The name "Palermo Stone" is sometimes used for all seven pieces of the Royal Annals, including those in museums in Cairo and London. The pieces are also sometimes known as the "Cairo Annals Stone". The name "Cairo Stone" is also used to mean only those pieces kept in Cairo.
The Royal Annals are probably the oldest historical writing from Ancient Egypt. They are very important for the study of Egyptian history in the Old Kingdom.
Description.
The Royal Annals stele, of which the Palermo Stone is one part part, was probably about 60 cm high and 2.1m wide. The pieces that are left are type of hard black stone, probably basalt.
The Palermo Stone itself is shaped like a shield. It is 43.5 cm high, 25 cm wide and 6.5 cm thick. The writing on the front of the stone is six lines of hieroglyphs. The first line lists the names of the Early Dynastic Period kings of Lower Egypt, wearing the Red Crown ). The second and other lines has parts of the royal annals for pharaohs of the First to Fourth Dynasties. These annals are lists of the key events in each year of the rule of each king, arranged in date order. The second line on the Palermo Stone begins with the last details for a king of the First Dynasty. The name has been lost, but it would be either Narmer or Aha. The rest of the second row has the first nine annual entries for next king. Again the name is missing but is either Aha or his successor Djer. The rest of the writing on this side has the royal annals down to the kings of the Fourth Dynasty.
There is writing on the back of the Palermo Stone. This lists events during the rule of pharaohs down to Neferirkare Kakai, third ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. From the pieces that are left it is unclear if the Royal Annals continued beyond this point in time. Where a king is named, the name of his mother is also recorded, such as Betrest mother of the First Dynasty king Semerkhet and Meresankh I mother of the Fourth Dynasty king Seneferu.
Details recorded in the Royal Annals includes the height of the annual Nile flood (see Nilometer), the Inundation, details of festivals (such as Sed festivals), taxation, sculpture, buildings, and warfare.
Archaeological history.
It is not known where the stele came from. None of the seven pieces has a proper archaeological history. One piece
in Cairo is said to have come from at an archaeological site at Memphis. The three other pieces in Cairo were said to have been found in Middle Egypt. No one has ever said where the Palermo Stone was found.
The Palermo Stone was purchased by a Sicilian lawyer, Ferdinand Guidano, in 1859. It has been in Palermo since 1866. On 19 October 1877, it was presented to the Palermo Archaeological Museum by the Guidano family.
There are five pieces of the Royal Annals in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Four of these were put in the Museum between 1895 and 1914. The fifth was purchased in 1963. One small piece is in the Petrie Museum of University College London, forming part of the collection of the archeologist Sir Flinders Petrie.
In 1895 a visiting French archaeologist realized the Palermo Stone was important. The writing on the stone was translated in 1902 by Heinrich Schäfer.
Problems.
There are arguments about the date of the Palermo Stone and of the Royal Annals it records. Historians do not agree if the writing was done in one go or was added to over time. There is no agreement about the date of the writing; was it written about the times it describes, or was it written much later? It has been argued that the stele was made much later, perhaps in the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty (747-656 BCE). It seems clear from the details that, even if the Royal Annals, on the Palermo Stone and other pieces, were not written soon after the time they describe, they are based on an Old Kingdom original.
There are also arguments about if all the pieces are part of the same stele or come from different copies. It has been suggested some of pieces in Cairo are not genuine.
The writing is difficult to read. This because of both the poor condition of some parts, and because of its great age. If the writing is a later copy, not from the Fifth Dynasty, there is also the chance that errors were made in the copying process.
Significance.
The Palermo Stone and the other pieces of the Royal Annals are a very important for the history of the Old Kingdom. For example, they list the names of members of the royal families during the first five dynasties which are not listed anywhere else.
New Kingdom Egyptian king lists, such as the Turin Canon (13th century BCE) and the Abydos king list (reign of Seti I, 1294–1279 BCE), say that Menes (probably Narmer) (c. 3100 or 3000 BCE) was the first king of the first dynasty. They say that he was the person who unified Egypt. However, the top line of the "Royal Annals" names some earlier rulers of Upper and Lower Egypt. These must come from a time before Egypt was unified. Linking the names of these kings with historical persons is still being argued about.
The ancient historian Manetho must have used something like the Royal Annals stele to write his history of the early dynasties of Egypt. This was written during the third century BCE. The king list which is the best match to his work is the Turin Canon.

Genets are Old World mammals. They are viverrids, in the same family as civet cats. They are feliform carnivores of the family Viverridae. 
The closest relatives of genets are the civets, linsangs, fossa, and mongooses. Almost all species are in the genus Genetta. The common genet, "Genetta genetta", is the only viverrid living in Europe. Other species live in Africa. Fossils of the genus have been found from the Pliocene.
Genets have long tails, about one to one and a half times the length of their bodies. These longs tails are a counterweight which helps them keep their balance as they leap from tree limb to tree limb. They are not strictly terrestrial, and spend much of their time in trees. Genets have semi-retractable claws, which they use for climbing and holding prey, but not for fighting.
Genets are highly agile creatures, with quick reflexes and exceptional climbing skills, and are the only viverrids that are able to stand bipedally. They are able to walk, trot, run, climb up and down trees, and jump.
They often feed on small mammals, such as rodents, shrews, and bats. Small rodents are captured by the back and killed with a bite at the head, then eaten starting with the head. They also eat birds, bird eggs, centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, and various fruits, including figs and olives.

Winnowing

Winnowing is a farming method developed by ancient peoples for separating grain from chaff. It is also used to remove weevils or other pests from stored grain. Threshing, which is the loosening of grain or seeds from the husks and straw, comes before winnowing.
In its simplest form it involves throwing the mixture into the air so that the wind blows away the lighter chaff. The heavier grains fall back down for recovery. This method is called "wind-grading". Other methods include using a winnowing fan (a shaped basket shaken to raise the chaff). Yet another is using a tool (a winnowing fork or shovel) on a pile of harvested grain.
Winnowing can also describe the natural removal of fine material from a coarser sediment by wind or flowing water. This is similar to separating wheat from chaff.

Therefore, the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent. All of them are cat-like in appearance. They are nocturnal, generally solitary tree dwellers. They are carnivorous, eating squirrels and other rodents, small birds, lizards and insects. Typical size is a little over 30 cm (1 foot), with a tail that more than doubles that length. Bodies are long, with short legs, giving a low appearance. All species have yellowish bodies with black markings (stripes, blotches and spots), though the distribution and nature of the markings varies between species.

Abutment

In engineering, abutment refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam. This is where the structure's superstructure rests or contacts. Single-span bridges have abutments at each end. These provide vertical and lateral (side to side) support for the bridge. They also act as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach. Multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans that are not supported by abutments. Dam abutments are generally the natural valley walls. They may also be artificial in order to support arch dams such as Kurobe Dam in Japan.
The term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an arch, or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a vault. The word derives from the verb "", meaning to "touch by means of a mutual border".

Corbel

In architecture a corbel or console is a structural piece of stone, wood or metal sticking out from a wall to carry a superincumbent weight. It is a type of bracket. A corbel is a solid piece of material in the wall. A console, by comparison, is a piece applied to the structure. A piece of structural wood projecting in the same way was called a "tassel" or a "bragger" in the UK. The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic, or New Stone Age, times. 
The word "corbel" comes from Old French and derives from the Latin "corbellus", a diminutive of "corvus" (a raven) which refers to the beak-like appearance. Similarly, the French refer to a bracket-corbel, usually a load-bearing internal feature, as a "corbeau" (a crow).

Turin King List

The Turin King List, also called the Turin Royal Canon, is a list of the kings of Egypt. It was written in Egyptian hieratic script on papyrus. It is thought to date from the rule of Pharaoh Ramesses II. The list is now in the Egyptian Museum in Turin. The papyrus is the most complete list of kings written by the Egyptians. It is the basis working out the dates of kings before the rule of Ramesses II.
Creation and use.
The papyrus is believed to have been written in the time of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty. The beginning and ending of the list are lost. There is no introduction, and the list stops after the 19th Dynasty. It may have been written at any later time, from Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty.
The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of their rule in years, with months and days for some kings. In some cases they are grouped together by family. This grouping is almost the same as the dynasties of Manetho’s book. The list includes the names of kings who only ruled for a very short time, or those ruling small areas that may not be in listed in other sources.
The list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (borders around the name of a king). They do have a hieroglyphic sign to show that they were foreigners.
The papyrus was a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt. It includes the mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. As the papyrus was reused for the tax roll, it shows the list was not of great formal importance to the writer. The list is thought to have been used as an administrative aid. As such, the papyrus is not supposed to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt up through at least the 19th Dynasty.
Discovery and reconstruction.
The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 at Luxor (Thebes). In 1824 was put in the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, and known as Papyrus Number 1874. When the box in which it had been taken to Italy was unpacked, the list had broken up into small pieces. Jean-Francois Champollion could read only some of the larger pieces which had royal names.
The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth (1796–1885) looked carefully at some of the pieces, some only one square centimeter in size. He made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not read the hieratic characters. Later work by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, largely agreed with Seyffarth's work.
In 1997 Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new version of the list in his book, "The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C." Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that many of the list’s names match historic monuments and other documents. However there are some differences and not all of the names match. The list may not be completely accurate for pre-Ramesses II chronology.
About 50% of the papyrus is missing. It is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 pieces. In 2009 new pieces were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition. A new edition of the papyrus is expected.
The name Hudjefa, is listed twice in the papyrus. The name is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of Ramesses II when the name of a king was unreadable or missing. 
Contents of the papyrus.
The papyrus is divided into eleven columns. The names and positions of several kings are still uncertain as the list is so badly damaged.

The Asiatic linsang ("Prionodon") is a genus with two species, the banded linsang ("Prionodon linsang") and the spotted linsang ("Prionodon pardicolor"). They are native to southeast Asia:
DNA analysis on 29 species showed that "Prionodon" was the sister-group of the family Felidae. So the Asiatic linsangs are put in a family of their own, the Prionodontidae. "Prionodon" is not closely related to the African linsangs, although they look similar, and live a similar life. They are small cat-like carnivores adapted to catching small prey among the trees of a tropical forest. The similarities between the two groups came about by convergent evolution.
"Prionodon" is basal to the Feliformia and a sister taxon of the Felidae.

Karnak king list

The Karnak king list, is a list of early Egyptian kings written in stone. It was in the southwest corner of the Festival Hall of Thutmose III. This hall was part of the Karnak Temple Complex, now Luxor, Egypt. It was written during the rule of Thutmose III. It has the names of 61 kings beginning with Sneferu from Egypt's Old Kingdom. Only the names of 39 kings can still be read. One name is not written in a cartouche (a border used around the name of a king). 
It is not a complete list of the Egyptian Pharaohs. This list has the names of kings of the First and Second Intermediate periods, which are left out in most other king lists.
It was first described by James Burton in 1825. In 1843, a German group directed by egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius was traveling up the River Nile to Karnak. A French adventurer, Émile Prisse d'Avennes, got there first. he pulled down the wall at night and took away the blocks with the lists. He had these blocks sent to France. Severely damaged, it is now on show at the Louvre in Paris.
The list.
This list has the name of the Pharaoh followed by the actual one written on the stone. The list is in three sections and is divided at the center. The numbering is from the sides, toward the center.

Class action

A class action, class suit, or representative action is a type of lawsuit. One of the parties is a group of people who are represented collectively by one member of that group. 
The class action originated in the United States. It is still mainly a U.S. phenomenon. However, several European countries with civil law have made changes to allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of consumers. 
In 1991 China passed the "Civil Procedure Law" that allows class actions. In Brazil class action suits have been brought against industries, banks. and other organizations. They have been used against environmental damage, product defects and false advertising to name a few. Unlike the US, Brazilian judges award much smaller amounts for damages.
The predecessor of the class action was called a "group litigation". They were used in England from the 13th century. It involved groups of people suing or being sued in in a court. Group cases were easier to handle than numbers of individual cases, because of the slow and difficult travelling at that time. Judges travelled round a circuit, and might visit a town only once or twice a year. By the 18th century individual lawsuits became the norm.

Trituberculata

The Trituberculata is an extinct group of mammals in the fossil record from about 215–85 illion years ago (mya). The discoveries were isolated teeth, so not much else can be said about the animals. They were small insectivores, and probably nocturnal. The group contains the ancestors of Placentalia and Marsupialia; all modern mammals except Monotremes are descended from trituberculates. 
The name comes from the three tubercles (cusps) of the molar teeth (not to be confused with Triconodonta). The clade Trituberculata is not always regarded as valid. They probably do not form a monophyletic group. Instead, some may be "true" basal mammals (though not always closest related to each other). Others (such as the symmetrodonts) may fall just outside the therian crown group.

Chevrolet K5 Blazer

The K5 Blazer was the smallest full-size SUV version of the Chevrolet C/K Truck family. It was added to the Chevrolet line in 1969. The full-size Blazer was replaced in 1992 by the Chevrolet Tahoe. In 1970, GMC introduced its own model of the truck, called the Jimmy. It was also discontinued in 1992 and replaced by the GMC Yukon. Both were based on the short wheelbase trucks. They were available with either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The K5 Blazer and Jimmy had "full convertible" removable tops until 1975. In 1976, GM introduced a half-cab design that was less prone to leaks. It was slightly safer in a rollover accident. These half cabs also had a removable top section. It started at a few inches behind the driver/passenger doors all the way back to the tailgate.
First generation 1969–1972.
When it was introduced in 1969, it was available as 4-wheel drive only. In 1970, a two-wheel-drive model was offered. There were four engine choices: the "250 in" straight-6, the "292" straight-6, the "307" V8, and the "350" V8.
The Blazer was designed and marketed to compete with International Harvester Scout and the Ford Bronco. Both of these were originally aimed at the short Jeep CJ series. But all three were much smaller than other trucks. The Blazer was a shortened pickup truck. This gave it increased interior space. It also lowered the cost of production with a shared platform. The Blazer quickly became popular. For the first time, it married the off-road capabilities of the Scout with the "luxury" features like air conditioning and automatic transmissions. At that time were usually available on cars. By 1970, the Blazer was already outselling both of its older rivals. It took Jeep (with the Cherokee) and Dodge (with the Dodge Ramcharger) to introduce similar models. Ford did not have a competing model until 1978 (Ford F-Series pickup). 
The two-wheel drive version came with independent front suspension and rear trailing arms, both with coil springs. The four-wheel drive version had a solid front axle and used leaf springs front and rear. Both versions used drum brakes at all four wheels until 1971. This is when the entire GM light truck line got standard front disc brakes. A tachometer was optional.
There was also a choice between a three-speed automatic transmission Turbo Hydromatic (TH350), a three-speed manual transmission, and a four-speed Synchromesh (SM465) manual transmission. Two transfer cases were offered. The Dana 20 was available only with the manual transmissions. The NP-205 was available with both types of transmissions. The Blazer had 8 in of ground clearance and an approach angle of 35°.
1973–1991.
In 1973, GM's line of full-size trucks was redesigned and updated. A tilt-steering wheel became optional. Although rear-wheel drive Blazers were manufactured until 1982, the majority sold were four-wheel drive.
Until 1975, the K5 had a removable convertible top. In 1976, a half-cab design was introduced and used until 1991.
The GMT400 platform was introduced in the spring of 1987 as for the 1988 model trucks. However, the K5 Blazer, Suburban, and crew-cab (four-door) trucks kept the earlier platform until 1991. In 1989, the front Grille (motor vehicle)}grille was changed to look like the ones used on the GMT400 series of pickups.
The K5 Blazer was available with a 305ci (1981–1987), 307ci (1973 only), 350ci (1973–1991), or 400ci (1973–1980) small blocks, the 250ci Inline-6 (1973–1984), or the 6.2L Detroit Diesel (1982–1987). Starting in 1981 the NP208 transfer case was used. From 1988 to 1991 the NP241 transfer case was used with some axles. 
The second generation K5 models made the rear hatch glass and tailgate into a single unit. This allowed the glass panel to retract inside the tailgate. It used either a manual handle or an electric motor to raise and lower the glass. For better fuel economy second generation Blazers used the smaller displacement 305 V-8. These engines produced nearly as much torque as the 350 V-8. However, these engines were not as powerful and prone to detonation (engine knocking). After 1987, when throttle-body injection was introduced in the truck engines, the 350 was made the standard engine.
M1009 CUCV.
Around 1981, a prototype K5 Blazer was used as a testbed for a military CUCV vehicle. Between 1983 and 1987, what is known as the M1009 CUCV was the production military version of the civilian K5. The differences are the lack of an air conditioner. They had an additional leaf spring in the suspension. Instead of the normal 12 V car battery the military version used a hybrid 12/24 volt system. It also had blackout headlights, front mounted brush guard, a rifle rack and special paint jobs. A majority of them are painted olive drab green or in the woodland camouflage pattern. Some M1009s that saw desert use were painted tan. All M1009s are powered with the 6.2 L Diesel engine. Some decommissioned M1009s end up in law enforcement use (for example with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department). Some were sold through government auctions. A few are still in use by the National Guard.

Wheelbase

In both road and rail vehicles, the wheelbase is the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.
Vehicles.
Because of the effect the wheelbase has on the weight distribution of the vehicle, wheelbase dimensions are very important to the balance and steering. In high performance vehicles a longer wheelbase is more stable at higher speeds. A short wheelbase vehicle is usually able to corner faster but may be less aerodynamic. The wheelbase, along with the track, affects a vehicle's steering angle (how sharply it can turn).
Wheelbase has an effect on a vehicle's turning radius (or turning circle). This is the smallest circle a car can turn or U-turn within. A long wheelbase car or truck cannot turn as sharply as a short wheelbase vehicle.
Towing and wheelbase.
If the vehicle is towing a trailer (in British English a caravan) the weight distribution of the trailer is critical. If too much of the trailer's weight, called "tongue weight", presses down on the vehicle's tow hitch (more than 15 percent) it can cause the vehicle to go out of control. Too little tongue weight (less than 10 percent) can cause the trailer to wikt:sway from side to side. this in turn can make the vehicle difficult or even impossible to control. The shorter the wheelbase the more quickly these forces can cause a loss of control. A longer wheelbase vehicle is generally more desirable for towing. Each vehicle has a tow rating showing how much weight it can tow safely.
Appearance.
A vehicle's wheelbase is also important to the overall aesthetic wikt:appeal of a car design. Wheelbase is part of the balance and proportion of a car. Some Luxury vehicles are offered with long wheelbases to increase the spaciousness and luxury of the vehicle. This is found most often on full-size cars. In contrast, coupé varieties of the some vehicles such as the Honda Accord are usually built on shorter wheelbases than the sedans they are based on.

The Abydos King List, also known as the Abydos Table, is a list of 76 kings of Ancient Egypt. It was written on a wall of the Temple of Seti I at Abydos, Egypt. The list has three rows of 38 cartouches (borders around the name of a king) in each row. The upper two rows list the kings, while the third row repeats Seti I's throne name and praenomen.
It lists the Old Kingdom kings in the order in which they ruled. It is the only record of the names of many of the kings of the Seventh and Eighth Dynasties.

<doc id="504632" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504632" title="Structural load">
Structural load

Structural loads or actions are forces, deformations, or accelerations applied to a structure or its components. A load is the amount of weight a structure has to carry. Loads cause stresses, deformations, and displacements in structures. Structural analysis is the calculation of the effects of loads on physical structures. Excess load or overloading may cause structural failure. This is a consideration in the design and construction of a structure.
Mechanical structures, such as aircraft, satellites, rockets, space stations, ships and submarines, have their own particular structural loads and actions. In a vehicle, especially trucks, the chassis is designed to carry the structural load. In many cars unibody construction is used where the metal skin (or other materials) is designed to carry the load. 
Gravity on Earth is an attractive force that affects all objects. A gravity load is one that the downward force of gravity affects.
Structural loads.
The following are typical loads exerted against most structures:
Aircraft structural loads.
For aircraft, loading is divided into two major categories: limit loads and ultimate loads. Limit loads are the maximum loads a component or structure may carry safely. Ultimate loads are the limit loads times a factor of 1.5 or the point beyond which the component or structure will fail. Gust loads are determined statistically and are provided by an agency such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Crash loads are loosely bounded by the ability of structures to survive the deceleration of a major ground impact. Other loads that may be critical are pressure loads (for pressurized, high-altitude aircraft) and ground loads. Loads on the ground can be from adverse braking or maneuvering during taxiing. Aircraft are constantly subjected to cyclic loading. These cyclic loads can cause metal fatigue.

South Saqqara Stone

The South Saqqara Stone is a large piece of stone. Written on the stone is a list of the pharaohs of the 6th dynasty of ancient Egypt. The list includes Teti, Userkare, Pepi I, Merenre and Pepi II. The list finishes with Pepi II which means it was probably written during his rule. The list is a record of the events which took place during each kings rule. However the stone was used later as the lid of sarcophagus. This was for the burial of the ancient Egyptian queen Ankhenespepi. A lot of the writing can not be read any longer.
Discovery.
The South Saqqara Stone was discovered in 1932-33 by Gustave Jéquier. It was in a storeroom, south of the pyramid of Queen Iput II. This is part of the pyramid complex of Pepi II at Saqqara. Saqqara was the main burial area for the city of Memphis.
Description.
The stone is a piece of basalt, 2.43 metres by 0.92 metres and 20 centimetres thick. It has writing on both sides, but much of the writing has been removed and is unreadable. 
Significance.
The writing on the South Saqqara Stone means it is an important object. The list of pharaohs has details about the annual or biannual cattle count. This matches details in other lists such as the Turin King List. This allows archaeologists to work out how long each king ruled. From the information on the stone it can be worked out that Teti ruled for at least 12 years, Userkare 2-4 years, Pepi I 49-50 years and 11-13 years for Merenre.
The Stone is one of the earliest historical documents in existence. It has the names of all the pharaohs known to the people who made it.

The Magnificent Seven is an American western movie. It was made in 1960. The music composer was Elmer Bernstein. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Original Music Score in 1960.
The movie stars Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach and Steve McQueen. The movie is a western style version of Akira Kurosawa's Japanese-language movie "Seven Samurai", made in 1954. Other actors are Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Horst Buchholz and Bing Russell. 
A Mexican village keeps on getting raided for food and supplies by a bandit (Eli Wallach) and his gang. The seven are a group of gunfighters hired to protect the village. The movie was made on location in Mexico. One of the towns used for the village is Durango. 
In 2013, the movie was picked by the Library of Congress to be kept in the National Film Registry because it is "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". This means the movie will be protected from damage that happens to older film that was used to make movies.
Reception.
When it was released, the movie did not get many good reviews. Howard Thompson of "The New York Times", said the movie was a "pallid, pretentious and overlong reflection of the Japanese original". He also said: "don't expect anything like the ice-cold suspense, the superb juxtaposition of revealing human vignettes and especially the pile-driver tempo of the first "Seven"." 
"Variety" magazine said, "Until the women and children arrive on the scene about two-thirds of the way through, "The Magnificent Seven" is a rip-roaring rootin' tootin' western with lots of bite and tang and old-fashioned abandon. The last third is downhill, a long and cluttered anti-climax in which "The Magnificent Seven" grow slightly too magnificent for comfort." 
But one reviewer, Akira Kurosawa, liked the movie so well that he gave the producer, John Sturges, a sword.
Over the years, the movie has become more liked and gets modern praise. Many of the actors became movie stars. They have been seen in other movies and on television. The movie itself also is shown on TV and can be seen on DVD. As of 2015, it has a freshness rating of 93 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Of movie viewers, 88 percent said they liked it. The film is also ranked 79 on American Film Institute's: AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills list.

This term comes from the French revolution when the monarchy was overthrown only to be replaced by several progressively more oppressive forms of governing. The most oppressive even renamed the months and renumbered the years because they were too Christian. One of the summer months was called Thermidor and because one of the revolutions took place in Thermidor, it became the namesake of the Thermidorian Reaction.

International Harvester Scout

 
The International Scout is an off-road vehicle which was made by International Harvester from 1961 to 1980. It was one of the earlier SUVs. The Scout was created as a competitor to the Jeep. Remarkably, the Scout went from a basic idea to production in only two years. Like the Jeep it had square utilitarian styling but had cleaner lines. It initially featured a fold-down windshield. The Scout and second generation Scout II were produced in Fort Wayne, Indiana as two-door trucks. They had the options of a half cab pickup or removable hard or soft top.
Background.
International Harvester began building trucks and pickups and later in 1907. In 1953 it added a truck-based people carrier, the Travelall. In the late 1950s it began to design a competitor for the two-door Jeep CJ 4x4. The 1961 model year Scout 80 made its debut in late 1960. Scouts began selling so well against Jeep, Ford jumped in with the Bronco and Chevrolet came out with the Blazer.
Production.
A concept for its replacement was started in 1964. It was approved for production in mid 1965. The Scout II was introduced in 1971. The basic sheet metal remained the unchanged until production stopped on October 21, 1980. During the 20 year period (1960–1980) 532,674 Scouts were produced. The Scout, introduced as a commercial utility vehicle in 1960, set the stage for future 4-wheel drive recreational vehicles of the '70s, '80s, and '90s.

The Ford Bronco is a utility vehicle that was produced from 1966 to 1996. It had five distinct generations. All these vehicles are currently classified as sport utility vehicles (SUV). The Broncos can be divided into two categories: early Broncos (1966–77) and full-size Broncos (1978–96).
The Bronco was introduced in 1966. It was a competitor to the small four-wheel drive compact SUVs that included the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout. It was built on its own platform. Ford positioned the Bronco between the Jeep and Scout. But it was too small to capture the US market. A major redesign in 1978 moved the Bronco to a larger size. It used a shortened Ford F-Series truck chassis to compete with both the similarly adapted Chevrolet K5 Blazer, as well as the Dodge Ramcharger.
The full-size Broncos and the successor Expedition were produced at Ford's Michigan Truck Plant in Wayne, Michigan.

Man with the iron mask

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
The Man with the iron mask was a prisoner of Louis XIV whose identity is not known. The man was imprisoned from 1669 until his death in 1703. The man was forced to wear a black cloth over his face most of the time; no one saw his face. The prisoner always had the same guardian. Most of the facts that are known are from correspondence, mostly of his guardian with his superiors. When he was first imprisoned, the identity of the man was given as "Eustache Dauger". He is buried in the graveyard of the church Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis in Paris. His tombstone says his name was "Marchiali". Other sources also give the names "Marchioly", or "Marchialy."
History.
The first time this man is mentioned is in a letter Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine wrote to Sophia of Hanover in 1711. She tells that he had to wear a mask, all the time, but knows nothing about his identity. In a letter of 1698, one of the guardians of the Bastille mentions that an elderly prisoner was being brought to the Bastille, and that this prisoner had to wear a mask. The guardian of the prisoner is Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars. This person had written many letters to François Michel Le Tellier de Louvois, the minister of war at the time. There was heavy censorship at the time; about 90% of the letters were lost.
On 24th August 1669, a man was imprisoned in Pinerolo. Pinerolo was called Pignerol and was part of France at the time. On 19th August, Louvois announced that this prisoner from Dunkerque was a very important person, but that he had not yet been arrested. The prisoner's name was given as Eustache Dauger. In Pinerolo, he met other important prisoners, such as Nicolas Fouquet or Antoine Nompar de Caumont. Dauger was allowed to talk to Fouquet. At times, Daguer acted as a servant to Fouquet, when Fouquet's servant was ill. In 1678, Fouquet asked for more freedom, and this wish was granted. At Fouquet's death in 1680, a hole was discovered between his cell and that of Caumont. From then onwards, both Fouquet's servant and Dauger were separated from Caumont. Both the man with the iron mask, and the servant of Fouquet were transferred to Exilles, which is only 26 km away.
In 1682, the two were separated. Fouquet's servant died in 1687. As Exilles was threatened by war, the man with the iron mask was transferred to the island of Sainte-Marguerite, next to Cannes. At that time, only one other person was imprisoned in Sainte-Marguerite. In September 1698, Dauger was transferred to the Bastille in Paris, where he died in 1703. Each time, the unknown prisoner was transferred this also applied to Saint-Mars, who rose in position. The transfer also applied to the few other prisoners Saint-Mars had to guard.
When he was in public, or with strangers, Dauger had to wear a mask. He also could not contact anyone. When he was transferred, people saw that no one could see his face, hear his voice, or speak to him.
Despite this, people always looked that he felt relatively at ease. He received new washed clothes twice a week, and could ask for any book he wanted. He was allowed to play the lute, and could see a doctor when there was the need to do so. Saint-Mars was given 12 livres a day, for food and drink of this prisoner. The cell that he occupied in Sainte Marguerite cost 5.000 livres to build. In Pinerolo, a special cell was built that had to be entered through three doors. This cell was soundproof, nothing could be heard outside the cell. Saint-Mars was personally responsible for the well-being of the man in the iron mask. There are testimonials that officers had to take off their hat in his presence, and that they were only allowed to put it back on when told to do so.
There are accounts that at the time of his death, the prisoner was about 60 years old. When he was transferred to Exilles in 1687, the prisoner had gray hair.
The mask.
The man with the iron mask did not wear a mask all the time. It is likely, that he only wore it when he was transferred, so that people could not recognize him. If he had worn the mask all the time, this would have led to infections. In addition, as the prisoner was male, the hair growing in his face needed cutting from time to time. The need for wearing a mask is mentioned only twice: In the document which ordered his transfer to the Bastille, and for the transfer to the island near Cannes.
Voltaire's invention?
Voltaire was imprisoned in the Bastille, in 1717. According to him, this prisoner was an older brother of the King. In 1751, he published his work A century of Louis XIV, where he spends a section detailing the story of the man with the iron mask. According to Voltaire, the man was imprisoned in 1661, after the death of Cardinal Mazarin. It is possible that most of what is known today was an invention of Voltaire, who used this man to give an example of how bad an absolute ruler could be.
The real Eustache Dauger.
When he announced the arrival of the prisoner in the very first letter, Louvois gave his name as "Eustache Dauger". Historians have found out that there was a man by that name, who was alive at that time. The full name of this man was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye. According to the records, Eustache was born on 30 August 1637 and was the son of François Dauger, a guard in the service of Cardinal Richelieu. They also found out, that Eustache seems to have been involved in what became known as Affair of the Poisons. This "affair" lasted from 1675 to about 1680. Many noblemen were poisoned, or executed for witchcraft. Eustache fell into disgrace when it became known that he had participated in lavish parties that included black masses, and possibly homosexual sex. In the 1930s, it was revealed that the real Eustache Daugher died in the Prison Saint-Lazaire in Paris. In the 17th century, the prison was an asylum for mentally ill people, run by monks. Many noble families used it to get rid of the "black sheep" of the family. Records show that the man really named Dauger was kept in Saint-Lazaire in Paris at about the same time the false Dauger was kept in Pignerolo. According to Louis-Henri de Loménie de Brienne who was also imprisoned in Saint-Lazaire at the time, the real Eustache Dauger de Cavoye died as a result of heavy drinking in the late 1680s. Historians consider all this proof enough that he was not involved in any way with the man in the mask.
Theories about the identity.
Candidates.
There are several theories, who this prisoner could have been. Some of the more likely ones are given below
Brother of Louis XIV.
Voltaire thought that this man was a twin brother of Louis XIV. According to Voltaire, this man had grown up in a different place than Louis XIV. He said that the man was imprisoned in 1661, a few months after the death of Jules Mazarin. Marcel Pagnol also has this hypothesis.
Illegitimate child of the Queen.
Another hypothesis is that the prisoner was a illegitimate child of the Queen, Anne of Austria. The father would either be Cardinal Mazarin, or George Villiers, 1. Duke of Buckingham or one of the musketeers. Cardinal Richelieu would have arranged this meeting. This theory is less likely, however, because the child would have had no right to the throne, and imprisoning him would therefore have been no use.
Father of Louis XIV.
The prisoner might have been the father of Louis XIV. Richelieu would have had a liaison with queen Anne, and both Louis XIV and Louis XIII would have been there to prevent Gaston de Bourbon, duc d’Orléans from becoming king.
Someone knowing about Louis' origins.
The autopsy of Louis XIII found that Louis XIII was unable to father children. Anyone knowing this would know about the origins of Louis XIV, and would be potentially dangerous to him. This theory is that the prisoner was in fact the doctor who had performed the autopsy.
Summary.
Today, there is no convincing theory that could explain who this man really was. The last person to have known the identity of this prisoner was probably Michel Chamillart, one of the ministers of the government of Louis XIV. Chamillart died in 1723.
Relative of the king.
Those theories that see the prisoner as part of the family of Louis XIV neglect that there was a lot of social control back then. The birth of a child in the court of the king, or even among nobles was a public event. Several hundred people were present at the birth of Louis XIV. The "secret birth" of a twin brother of Louis is highly unlikely. The amount of social control made it almost impossible that Anne of Austria had an affair. Anne was pregnant several times, which means that her husband, Louis XIII was able to father children. Another fact that speaks against the theory that the prisoner was a relative of the king is that the prisoner had the post of a servant, at times. At the times of Louis XIV, people of noble birth would not become servants.
Servant.
The theories that see the prisoner as a servant also have their weaknesses: Even though he was imprisoned, he had a comfortable life. A simple servant would have been killed, and no one would have cared about his comfort. Despite this, Louis XIV, the king himself took interest in the well-being of the prisoner.
Literature.
There are several books and movies about this man. The best known of these are probably the story by Alexandre Dumas called "The Vicomte de Bragelonne" (which is the third volume of his work The Three Musketeers), the story The Twins, by Victor Hugo and The Iron Mask by Marcel Pagnol. Dumas also gives a summary of the theories about the prisoner, which were common at his time.
The story has been used for several movies.

Epstein–Barr virus

The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), also called human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), is one of eight viruses in the herpes family. It is one of the most common viruses in humans.
EBV is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). It is also associated with some forms of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). EBV may be associated with a higher risk of certain autoimmune diseases. Some 200,000 cancer cases per year may be caused by (or associated with) EBV. 
Infection with EBV occurs by the transfer by mouth (oral transfer) of saliva and genital secretions. 
Most people become infected with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. In the United States, about half of all five-year-old children and about 90 percent of adults have evidence of previous infection. Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are just mild, brief illnesses of childhood. In the United States and other developed countries, many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence, it causes glandular fever 35 to 50 percent of the time.
EBV infects B cells of the immune system and epithelial cells. Once EBV's initial infection is brought under control, non-active EBV stays in the person's B cells for the rest of their life.

Minesweeper

A minesweeper is a small naval warship designed to sweep the water clear of mines. Minesweepers keep oceans and rivers clear for shipping.
In Great Britain, naval leaders knew before World War I that sea mines were a threat to the nation's shipping. The real threat was not invasion, but blockade aided by mines. Fishing nets pulled behind boats gave an idea on how to clear mines. The Royal Navy used fishermen and their fishing trawlers to keep the English Channel clear of mines. They were supplied with mine gear, rifles, uniforms and pay as the first minesweepers. 
The dedicated, purpose-built minesweeper first appeared during World War I. By the end of the war, naval mine technology had grown beyond the ability of minesweepers to detect and remove.
Minesweeping made big advances during World War 2. Fighting nations quickly adapted ships to the task of minesweeping. Both Allied and Axis countries made heavy use of minesweepers throughout the war. Underwater mines remained a problem even after the war ended, and minesweepers were still in use after Japan surrendered to the United States.
After World War 2, allied countries worked on new types of minesweepers. The United States Navy used special landing craft (shallow-water boats) to clear shallow harbors in and around North Korea. s of June 2012[ [update]], the U.S. Navy had four minesweepers in the Persian Gulf.

Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter

The Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (Latin: "Fraternitas Sacerdotalis Sancti Petri"; for short: "F.S.S.P.") is a group of Catholic priests and seminarians who want to say the Mass and other sacraments the way they were said before the Second Vatican Council.
Church laws.
According to the laws of the Catholic Church, the F.S.S.P. is a "Clerical Society of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right". This means that members have to follow the same rules as diocesan clergy and also swear an oath as members of the Society. The Fraternity was established by the Pope, and local bishops are not allowed to tell the Fraternity what to do. Instead, the Pope is in charge of them, through an organization called "Ecclesia Dei". A local bishop is still in charge of the Fraternity's work within his own diocese.
Purpose.
The members of the F.S.S.P. are priests and seminarians who want to express their faith in a specific way. This way is to offer the Mass and other sacraments using the Roman Rite, the way it was before it was changed after the Second Vatican Council. Because of this, the Fraternity uses books of worship from the ueat 1964, including the Roman Missal, the Roman Breviary, the Pontifical ("Pontificale Romanum"), and the Roman Ritual.
The Fraternity has two purposes: make their priests become holy people, and to send these priests to parishes. They celebrate the sacraments, teach people about Catholicism, give retreats, organize pilgrimages, and provide a full sacramental and cultural life for Catholics who also want to use the liturgy of the 1962 missal. The Fraternity has built its own seminaries to train their own priests to do these things.
Founding.
The F.S.S.P started with members of the traditional Catholic group, the Society of St. Pius X (S.S.P.X.). In 1988, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre wanted to make four priests from the S.S.P.X. into bishops. Pope John Paul II did not let him do it, but he did it anyway. The Pope and the Congregation of Bishops said that this was a schismatic act, which meant that the S.S.P.X. was not part of the Catholic Church any more. Twelve priests and several seminarians, led by Father Josef Bisig, did not agree with the decision of Archbishop Lefebvre, and started the F.S.S.P as their own group on July 18, 1988. Father Josef Bisig became the Fraternity's first superior general.
Organization.
In 2011, the Fraternity had 392 people in it: 228 priests, 10 deacons, and 154 seminarians in 117 dioceses around the world. There are people in the Fraternity from 35 countries. There is also a group of lay members called the Confraternity of Saint Peter with 3,487 people in it.
Superiors General.
The person in charge of the F.S.S.P. is called the superior general. The Very Reverend John Berg is the superior general right now. He is helped by the Vicar General and Assistant, the Very Reverend Patrick du Faÿ.
Districts and regions.
The Fraternity has people all over the world, so people in different parts of the world are split into three districts and two regions:
Educational institutions.
The Fraternity has two seminaries:
The Fraternity runs a boarding school called St. Gregory's Academy in Elmhurst, Pennsylvania, USA. It also runs Ezekiel House, a house for seminarians who have studied for less than one year, in Sydney, Australia.

Australopithecus deyiremeda

Australopithecus deyiremeda is an extinct hominin which lived about 3.4 million years ago in northern Ethiopia. This was around the same time and place as several previously discovered specimens of "Australopithecus afarensis" were found. They include the well known Lucy.
The discovery was in the Afar Region of Ethiopia about 325 mi (520 kilometers) northeast of the capital Addis Ababa and 22 mi north of Hadar, Ethiopia (“Lucy’s” site). 
Teeth in the fossil jaw suggest that the species had a different diet from "A. afarensis".
Yohannes Haile-Selassie, the curator of physical anthropology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History has said that "The Woranso-Mille study area has thus far yielded more than 120 early hominin fossil specimens dated to between 3.4 and 3.8 million years ago".
Haile-Selassie told the BBC: "We had to look at the detailed anatomy and morphology of the teeth and the upper and lower jaws, and we found major differences. This new species has very robust jaws. In addition, we see this new species had smaller teeth. The canine is really small – smaller than all known hominins we have found in the past". 
This was perhaps one of four different species of early humans that were all alive at the same time.

Cyborg is a 1989 martial arts and science fiction movie. The movie is about post-apocalyptic times.
Production.
Cannon Films had planned to make a sequel to the 1987 He-Man movie "Masters of the Universe" and a live action version of 'Spider Man'. Both projects were planned to shoot at the same time by Albert Pyun. Cannon, however, was in financial trouble. They had to cancel deals with both Mattel and Marvel Entertainment. Cannon had already spent $2 million on costumes and sets for both movies. They decided to write a new project to recoup the money spent on them. Then Pyun wrote the storyline for "Cyborg" in one weekend. The movie was shot for less than $500,000 and filmed in 23 days. It was shot entirely in Wilmington, North Carolina.
Jackson "Rock" Pinckney, who played one of Fender's pirates, lost his eye during filming when Jean-Claude Van Damme struck his eye with a prop knife. Pinckney sued Van Damme in a North Carolina court and was awarded $485,000.
Violent scenes were removed from the movie to achieve an R rating rather than an X rating. That included a throat slitting and some blood and gore in the village massacre. Also removed was the death of a man Van Damme was fighting.
Reception.
The movie got negative reviews from movie critics. However, the movie was successful in the box office. It got back over $10 million total.

Sneakers is a 1992 American crime fiction comedy movie. It stars Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell, River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier, and David Strathairn. This was the second time Phoenix and Poitier starred together in a movie. The first was "Little Nikita" in 1988. 
Plot.
In 1969, students Martin Brice and Cosmo are hacking into computer networks. They are called "sneakers". They are at college. They are switching money illegally. The police burst in and arrest Cosmo while Martin is out getting pizza. Martin runs away and is a fugitive.
After a number of years, Martin, now called Martin Bishop, is heading a group of security specialists in San Francisco. They are: Donald Crease, a former CIA officer and family man; Darren "Mother" Roskow, who believes in conspiracy theory; Carl Arbogast, a young genius; and Irwin "Whistler" Emery, a blind phone expert.
The National Security Agency knows who Martin really is. They offer to clean his record, but he has to steal a "black box" from a mathematician, Dr. Gunter Janek. Janek made the box for the Russian government. Martin agrees to help. With help from his former girlfriend, Liz, Martin and his team get the box, which is disguised as an answering machine. Whistler, Mother, and Carl discover that the box can break the encryption code of nearly every computer system. Martin says no one can leave the building until they can deliver the box the next day.
Martin gives the box to the NSA officers, but quickly leaves after Crease discovers that Janek was killed the night before. He finds out from a friend named Gregor in the Russian consulate, that the officers were not real agents, and that Janek was working for the NSA. 
Fake FBI agents kill Gregor and kidnap Martin. While kidnapped, he again meets Cosmo, who Martin thought had died in prison. While in prison, Cosmo got involved with organized crime, who helped him escape and get wealthy. He wants to use Janek's box to ruin the world economy. He asks Martin to join him. Martin says no, and so Cosmo uses the box to break into the FBI's files to change Martin's name back to Brice. Martin is knocked out and taken back to the city.
Martin calls his team for help. NSA agent Abbott, who wants the box, says Martin has to get it before he can help. By trickery, the team breaks into the building to recover the box. But Cosmo has been tipped off about a possible break-in. Cosmo locks down the building and holds Martin at gunpoint. Again he asks Martin to join him, but Martin refuses and the team escapes.
Back at their offices, Martin's team is met by NSA agents ready to arrest the group. But Martin convinces the NSA how important the secrecy of the box is to their agency. Abbott agrees to clear Martin's record and grant the requests of the rest of his team. After Abbott and the agents leave with the box, Martin shows his team he has ruined it by taking out the main processor.
Making the movie.
Lasker and Parkes got the idea for "Sneakers" in 1981, while working on "WarGames". Once Robert Redford agreed to be in the movie, people who wanted to work with him then joined the cast and crew. This included the director, Robinson, who had little interest in the movie before.
"I can't remember having so much fun on a movie," Tobolowsky said in a 2012 anniversary article for the website for "Slate". He first laughed at the script just because of its title. After his agent talked him into reading it, he changed his mind. He then said to his agent, "Now I know what a hundred million dollars at the box office reads like." The rest of the cast and crew also liked working on the movie. Near the end of the shoot Robinson said the only way it could have been better would have been if the lab lost the film, so they would have had to do it all over again.
Reception.
The movie got mixed reviews when it was released. Writing for the "Los Angeles Times", Kenneth Turan said "Sneakers" is "[a] caper movie with a most pleasant sense of humor," a "twisting plot," and a "witty, hang-loose tone." He also praised the director, who is "surprisingly adept at creating tension at appropriate moments" and "makes good use of the script's air of clever cheerfulness". 
Roger Ebert gave the movie two-and-a-half stars out of four, saying it is "a sometimes entertaining movie, but thin." 
Vincent Canby, in a negative review for "The New York Times", said the movie looked like it had "just surfaced after being buried alive for 20 years". He said that Redford and Poitier looked and acted too old. He said the plot was "feeble," and that the movie was "jokey without being funny, breathless without creating suspense". He calls the ensemble an "all star gang," but says the "performances are generally quite bad." It currently holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 47 reviews with an average rating of 6.8/10.
The movie was a box office success, making over $105.2 million worldwide.

Cyborg

A cyborg (short for "cybernetic organism") is a theoretical or fictional being with both organic and manufactured parts. 
The term was coined in 1960. D.S. Halacy's "Cyborg: evolution of the superman" in 1965 spoke of a "new frontier" that was "not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' – a bridge...between mind and matter".
The term cyborg is not the same thing as bionic. It is often applied to an organism that has restored or enhanced abilities, done by some artificial part, by or technology that relies on some sort of feedback. 
While cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals, they might also conceivably be any kind of organism and the term "cybernetic organism" has been applied loosely to all sorts of things. The term can also apply to micro-organisms which are modified to perform at higher levels than their unmodified counterparts. It is thought that cyborg technology may form a part of humanity's future.

Two-wheel drive

Two-wheel drive (2WD) describes vehicles in which, in theory, two wheels receive power from the engine at the same time. Usually the two wheels are on the same axle in the drivetrain. Most vehicles with two-wheel drive are mainly for use on roads and highways. Two-wheel drive cars and trucks are either front- (FWD) or Rear-wheel drive (RWD). This means either the front or the rear axle is the "drive axle" that moves the vehicle forward. When the vehicle begins to accelerate, some of the weight of the vehicle is shifted to the rear giving a rear-wheel drive car or better balance and traction. Two-wheel drive systems are simple and rugged. This is why rear-wheel drive is so popular in police cars and other service vehicles.
Disadvantages.
Traditional two-wheel drive systems have a differential in the rear axle. This is used for turning the vehicle. If both drive wheels rotated at exactly the same rate, the vehicle would have difficulty going around a corner. In a turn, the outside wheel has to go faster to keep up with the inside wheel (which turns slower). A differential allows one wheel to turn faster under these conditions. This means only one of the two wheels actually has power at any given time. A differential also prevents excessive tire wear. 
Of the two drive types, RWD has more disadvantages. In wet or slippery conditions, having effectively only one drive wheel, the tires are going to slip and lose traction. A FWD (not to be confused with 4WD) vehicle will have better traction, but in snow and icy conditions will not equal a four-wheel drive car or truck.

Anne Braden

Anne Braden (July 28, 1924 – March 6, 2006) was an American civil rights activist and newspaper journalist. She worked for newspapers in Louisville, Kentucky, Anniston, Alabama and Birmingham, Alabama. She also worked for the African American civil rights movement.
Early activism.
In 1948, she married Carl Braden. He was a journalist too. They were interested in Henry Wallace's campaign to be President of the United States. Not long after Wallace lost, they left mainstream journalism. After World War II, the labor movement grew less aggressive. It began to break apart into smaller groups. At the same time, civil rights causes heated up. 
In the 1940s, some hospitals were racially segregated. Black people were not treated in the same area as white people. In 1950, Anne Braden led a hospital racial integration drive in Kentucky. She wanted to show that such racial segregation was a bad idea. In 1951 she led a group of southern white women organized by the Civil Rights Congress to Mississippi. During that march, she was arrested. They were protesting against the execution of Willie McGee, an African American. He had been convicted of the rape of a white woman, Willette Hawkins.
The Wade case.
Anne Braden is probably best known for something that happened in 1954. The Wade family asked the Bradens for help. Andrew Wade was an African American who wanted to buy a house in white suburban Louisville, Kentucky. Because of Jim Crow housing practices, the Wades had been unsuccessful for months to buy a home on their own. The Bradens agreed to buy the house and resell it to the Wades. On May 15, 1954, Andrew Wade and his wife Charlotte spent their first night in their new home. When white neighbors discovered that black people had moved in, they burned a cross in front of the house. They shot out windows. A few days later, a stone was thrown through a window. The milkman would not deliver milk. Someone cancelled their newspaper subscription. White friends began staying in the house to guard against further violence. After a few weeks, the incidents quieted down. However, just after midnight on June 27, 1954 a bomb went off in the house. It was under the room the Wade's two-year-old daughter slept in. Nobody was home at the time.
The Bradens and five other whites were charged with sedition. They were accused of trying to start a race war. They were also accused of blowing up the house themselves to try to overthrow the government of Kentucky. This happened during the time of McCarthyism. Anyone could be accused of being a communist and many were. Carl Braden was said to be a communist troublemaker. He spent eight months in prison. The Supreme Court ruled a year later in a Pennsylvania case. It said sedition was a federal crime, not a state crime. Carl Braden's state conviction was cancelled. The charges were dropped against the other defendants. The Wades moved back to Louisville.
Life.
Anne Braden was born in Louisville, Kentucky. She died there at age 81.

Lawrence Oates

Lawrence Edward Grace "Titus" Oates or Captain Lawrence Oates (March 17, 1880 – March 16, 1912) was a British cavalry officer and an Antarctic explorer. He died during the Terra Nova Expedition of 1910–13. Oates, who had gangrene and frostbite, walked from his tent into a blizzard. His death is seen as an act of sacrifice. When he knew that his sickness risked the survival of his three crew mates, he chose certain death.
Early life.
Oates was born in Putney, London, England in 1880. His parents were William and Caroline Oates. His family was rich. They had owned land at Gestingthorpe, Essex, for hundreds of years. His father moved the family there when his children were small. He had an older sister, named Lillian, who married an Irish singer and actor. His uncle was a naturalist and African explorer. Oates studied at Eton College, but he left after less than two years because of poor health. He then attended an army school in Eastbourne. 
Expedition to the South Pole.
In 1910, he joined Robert Falcon Scott's expedition to the South Pole. He was chosen because he had worked with horses. He took care of the nineteen ponies that pulled the sleds carrying food for the trip. Scott then picked Oates for the five-man team to travel the last distance to the Pole.
Captain Scott, Captain Oates and 14 others left base camp on November 1,1911. During the 895 mi trip, some members of the crew were sent back by Scott in teams. On January 4, 1912, only the five-man team with Scott and Oates, were left to walk the last 167 mi to the Pole. 
On January 18, 1912, they reached the Pole. They found that Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen and his team, had beaten them to be first to the Pole. Inside the tent was a note from Amundsen saying that that he had reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911.
The return trip.
On the way back, Scott's team had many problems: very bad weather, poor food supply, injuries from falls, scurvy and frostbite. On February 17, 1912, Edgar Evans died from a head wound after falling into a deep crack in the ice a few days earlier. 
Oates' feet were badly frostbitten. He was getting weak faster than the others. In his diary, Scott wrote on March 5: "Oates' feet are in a wretched condition... The poor soldier is very nearly done." The others did not want to leave him behind. This caused the team to be late getting back. They were running out of food and fuel. On March 15, Oates told his friends that he could not go on. He asked them to just leave him in his sleeping bag, but they said no. He travelled a few more miles that day but got worse that night.
Death.
When he woke up the next morning, Oates walked out of the tent into a blizzard and -40 °F temperatures to his death. Scott wrote in his diary, "We knew that poor Oates was walking to his death, but though we tried to dissuade him, we knew it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman." 
Scott and the other two walked another 20 mi. Then they were stopped by a fierce blizzard on March 20. Trapped in their tent by the weather and weak, cold and hungry, they died nine days later. Their frozen bodies were found by a search party on November 12, 1912. 
Oates' body was never found. Near where they thought he died, the search party left a pile of stones and a cross. These words were left: "Hereabouts died a very gallant gentleman, Captain L. E. G. Oates... In March 1912, returning from the Pole, he walked willingly to his death in a blizzard, to try and save his comrades, beset by hardships."
Oates' reindeer-skin sleeping bag was found. It is now in the museum of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, with other items from the expedition.
Last words.
Scott wrote in his diary that before Oates left the tent and walked to his death, he said "I am just going outside and may be some time."

Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetics is a branch of pharmacology which studies what the body does to a drug. Pharmacokinetics looks at how a substance enters, moves through and exits the body. It relates how the dose delivered affects the concentration within the body. It is closely related to another branch of pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, which describes how a drugs affects the body.
ADME.
When developing new drugs, it is important to know exactly what happens to the chemical once administered. There are four important parameters of pharmacokinetics, usually known by the acronym ADME: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion. This model was developed in order to simplify perception of the many processes that take place once a drug enters an organism.
Absorption.
Absorption describes the movement of a drug from the dosage form to the site of action, usually the blood.
The bioavailability (F) of the drug is the fraction of the drug being administered that reaches the blood circulation.
Effects of lipid solubility acidity.
Once the drug is in the body, it enters many cells. Cells are surrounded by a protective membrane made of lipid bilayer. For this reason, only lipid soluble, (lipophillic) drugs can enter cells.
Sometimes the substance gets trapped within the lipids of waste products that need excreted, and leave the body without ever being absorbed.
For this reason, there must be a balance between lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of drug molecules.
The acidity of a pharmaceutical compound can also affect absorption. It is important to know how acid or basic the substance is in order for the body to accept it, giving our bodies a biological effect. 
Parental route of administration.
One way to overcome the need to absorb the drug in the stomach (where it can be destroyed by bile), is to inject it in the skin (intradermal), subcutaneously, in the muscle (intramuscular) or directly into the bloodstream (intravenously). 
Other routes include the topical route, where the drug is applied directly to the skin or mucosal surface on which it is intended to act. These drugs are also known as ointments and include eye drops, thrush cream and eczema lotion. Though absorption is slow, there is a high concentration of the substance in this one area, meaning a pharmacological affect at only the site of application is produced.
Nasal spray and inhalers are other routes of admission which bypass the stomach.
Distribution.
Distribution describes the process by which a drug moves about in the body once it has entered blood circulation, and how this movement may decrease the concentration. 
The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is the apparent volume into which the drug is distributed, expressed in liters (L).
Vd = Dose/Initial plasma concentration
Vd is a hypothetical volume of fluid that will contain the total amount of drug administered to the body. One inside thebody, the drug can move around either by diffusion (soaking through a membrane due to a lower concentration), or by transport in the blood. The body should be considered as being multicompartmental, where drugs can be distributed into plasma (blood) - 8% , interstitial fluid (a liquid that surrounds tissues) - 24%, intracelullar fluid (which surrounds cells) - 65% and also fat.
A lower Vd value infers that the drug is retained within the plasma.
A higher Vd value suggests that the drug is retained in volumes outside of the plasma (i.e. in peripheral tissues).
Factors affecting drug distribution.
There are many factors which affect drug distribution, the most important ones are the following:
Metabolism.
Metabolism describes the process by which a drug is altered chemically in the body into its metabolite, which may be more or less active. This process usually occurs in the liver, but can also take place in the plasma, lungs, stomach, small intestine, kidney and skin. It contains two phases: phase 1 and phase 2.
Put simply, this process converts lipid soluble drugs to water soluble metabolites.
First pass metabolism.
All drugs that are absorbed from the small intestine are first transported to the liver by the hepatic portal vein, in many cases a large proportion of the drug is then metabolized immediately before the drug enters the systemic circulation. This process is called first pass metabolism.
Some drugs undergo extensive first pass metabolism such that only about 10% of the administered dose enters the circulation: "10% bioavailability".
In the case of some drugs, the metabolism occurs within the gut before even reaching the liver.
Kinetics of drug elimination.
Can be zero order or first order:
Excretion.
This is an elimination process by which a drug or its metabolite is removed from the body. Usually this occurs in the kidneys (urine), but can also take place in the biliary system (faeces), gastrointestinal tract (GIT), skin (sweat) and lungs (expired air).
Factos effecting drug excretion.
Many of the products of hepatic metabolism are water soluble metabolites of lipid soluble drugs, these enter the systemic circulation and are transported to the kidney where they are eventually excreted in the urine.
Drugs and metabolites that are in free aqueous solution may also be excreted in sweat or expired air. Where the drug or metabolite is not freely water soluble, it is normally excreted into the gut via the bile duct from when it is excreted in the faeces. 
One complication of this route of excretion is the enterohepatic shunt. In this process the drug is excreted into the guy from the bile duct, but is then reabsorbed and transported back to the liver. The consequence of this is that the presence of the drug or metabolite within the body is extended, which, if the metabolite is pharmacologically active, may extend the duration of action of the drug.
Some chemicals, for example lead, accumulate within the tissues.
Factors effecting plasma drug concentration.
The actual concentration of drug present within the plasma (bloodstream) following administration is dependent on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Plasma concentrations of a drug after administration of identical doses either by intravenous injection or orally. Only about half of the dose administered orally actually enters circulation, however the plasma half-life of the drug is approximately 3 hours both orally and via IV.
In most therapeutic circumstances, drugs are not given as a single dose but as multiple doses. This has profound effects on the plasma concentrations achieved. The state of constant maxima and minima is called "steady state". This is the point where rate of drug availability equals rate of elimination, and the optimum therapeutic effect is reached.

1953 British Mount Everest expedition

The British Mount Everest expedition of 1953 was the ninth attempt to reach the summit of Mt. Everest. It was also the first expedition that made it to the top. The journey was lead by Colonel John Hunt, who was hired by the Everest organizing committee to lead the expedition. The military-style expedition was "bottom heavy" by today's standards. There were tons of equipment hauled by 350 porters to support only ten climbers. Edmund Hillary, an explorer, and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepalese mountain climber, were one of the pairs chosen to climb to the top. Other teams would also try. Finally, on May 29, Hillary and Tenzing made it to the top. They could only stay on the summit for 15 minutes or risk running out of oxygen. They began the long climb back down to the basecamp. They arrived exhausted and unable to speak. When Hunt saw them he thought they failed and began arranging for another team to try. But the two gestured that the climb had been a success. Hilary and Norgay became instant heroes.

Subcompact car

A subcompact car is the American term for an automobile with a class size smaller than a compact car. Usually they are not longer than 165 in. They are larger than a microcar. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a passenger car is classified as subcompact if it has between 85 cuft and 99 cuft of interior volume.
The subcompact group is roughly the same as A-segment and B-segment cars in Europe. They also are similar in size to a city car and supermini in British terminology. In 2012, the New York Times described the differences, saying "today’s small cars actually span three main segments in the global vehicle market". The tiny A-segment cars include the Chevrolet Spark and Smart Fortwo. They’re extremely short and very light. Slightly larger are B-segment cars like the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic. The most popular subcompact cars include the Chevrolet Sonic/Aveo and the Ford Fiesta.

Humphrey (cat)

Humphrey (c. 1988 – March 2006) was a cat who worked at 10 Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He lived there from October 1989 to 13 November 1997. His title was "Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office". 
He first came as a one-year-old stray cat. He served as chief cat for Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair. He went into retirement six months after the Blairs moved into Downing Street. He took over for the previous cat, Wilberforce. He was sometimes said to be a real employee at Number 10, by journalists.
Start of employment.
Humphrey was found as a stray by a Cabinet Office civil servant. He was named in honour of Sir Humphrey Appleby, a civil servant character on British televsion. After the previous mouser, Wilberforce, had died, the Cabinet Office and Number 10 were in need of a replacement, so Humphrey began his work.
He was often seen posing for pictures in front of the famous Number 10 front door. His main job was catching mice and rats in the maze of Downing Street buildings. The poor quality of the buildings, some of which were built in the 16th century, and the nearby St. James's Park made them a sure place for pests.
Goes missing.
In June 1995, Humphrey went missing. Downing Street did not tell the public about this until Sheila Gunn, a writer for "The Times", found out. Gunn had told a member of staff that her own cat had died and they shared about the missing cat. Gunn's story was mentioned on the front page. He was then found in a nearby medical college. He had been taken in as a stray and renamed PC, short for "patrol cat". 
When he came back to Downing Street, Humphrey gave a news report saying: "I have had a wonderful holiday at the Royal Army Medical College, but it is nice to be back and I am looking forward to the new parliamentary session."
Humphrey and the Blairs.
Within a week of Tony Blair moving to 10 Downing Street after the May 1997 general election, newspapers said that Humphrey and Cherie Blair, the new Prime Minister's wife, were not getting along. Mrs Blair was said to either be allergic to cats or believed them to be unclean. Sheila Gunn, later said that she was the source of these reports. Her obituary says they were based "on a hunch for which she had no evidence".
At the time, an official for the family said that Humphrey would not be moving out, saying that Number 10 "is Humphrey's home and, as far as the Blairs are concerned, it will remain his home". A photo of Humphrey and Mrs Blair was given to the press. This did not calm fears that the cat would be forced out. Rumours went around that Humphrey was drugged by press secretary Alastair Campbell, before being taken away. 
In November 1997, Humphrey's personal caregiver, Jonathan Rees, who worked for the Prime Minister, wrote a letter saying that the cat should retire to a "stable home environment where he can be looked after properly". While kidney problems were given as the reason for his retirement, many believed that Mrs Blair caused it.
Later life.
Humphrey moved to his new home with an older couple in the suburbs of London on 13 November 1997. The news of his retirement was not told until the next day, because there was fear that the cat might be kidnapped.
Little was heard about Humphrey over the next few years. Many people though that he had died. 
"The Daily Telegraph" made a "Freedom of Information Act" request for documents about him in early 2005. This led to more information being uncovered about his time at Downing Street. In its March 2005 report about Humphrey, the "Telegraph" sadly said "Where Humphrey is now - or even whether he is still with us - remains a mystery. 'I am not having much luck,' a Cabinet Office spokesman confessed last night. His official minder has not heard from him in seven years." Finally, on 22 July 2005, "The Independent" reported that "the 17-year-old mouser is alive and well and living in south London." 
Death.
In March 2006, an official for Tony Blair reported that Humphrey had died the week before. He died at his offical retirement home.

606 (urban trail)

606 (The 606 Park and Trail) is an elevated urban trail in Chicago. It was made by replacing elevated railroad tracks with a path for bicyclists, walkers and runners.
The trail is in Chicago's Northwest Side, at Bloomingdale Ave (1800N), between Armitage and North. It is 2.7 miles long. It runs east and west. The eastern end is at Walsh Park, on Ashland Avenue (1600W). The park's western end will be at Ridgeway Trailhead (3750W), when Phase 2 is completed. The official opening is scheduled for June 6, 2015. 
The first construction phase of the 606 was completed in 2015. It was developed by the City of Chicago, the city's park district and the Trust for Public Land. The name comes from the first three digits of Chicago's ZIP Code. "In its original state, it was the elevated Bloomingdale [train] Line, completed in 1915 along Bloomingdale Avenue..." 
The trail is about 17.5 feet above street level at its highest point. Original retaining walls are on each side. The walls are filled with a subsoil from when the structure was first built. The ballast and railroad ties and trackes were removed in the conversion to a trail. On top of the subsoil are other soil layers. These were re-built as part of the conversion. On top of the soil is an 8-inch layer of concrete. This top layer is 14 feet wide. In the middle is a 10-foot wide section for bicyclists. On either side is a 2-foot shoulder for runners and walkers. Beyond the shoulders are palnted areas with grass, trees and lighting. At some places, there are benches A fence or railing of varying height runs along the length of the path. There are 17 ramps and one staircase along the trail.

Ice fishing

Ice fishing is the practice of catching fish through an opening in the ice on a frozen body of water. The methods include fishing with fishing rods, lines and hooks or spears. Ice fishermen may fish in the open or in heated enclosures called ice shacks. 
Equipment.
Basic ice fishing equipment is fairly simple. A short fishing rod, some bait, hooks and a way to drill or chop a hole in the ice. The right clothing is also important to keep warm on the ice. Or, you could get into highly specialized ice fishing gear. 
Ice shacks.
An important part of ice fishing in the northern parts of North America is the ice shack (ice house, ice shanty, dark house). These are dragged or towed onto the lake using a vehicle such as a snowmobile, ATV or truck. Most portable ice houses which are often made of anything from light tent-like structures to heavy material that designed to shelter fishermen from cold and wind. They can take many different forms. Some are simple structures that are just a place to get in out of the cold. Others are elaborate expensive shelters, warm and safe enough to withstand any weather. They are also loaded with electronics. 
Modern ice shacks can have equipment like underwater cameras, sonar fish-finders and lake-mapping apps for their smartphones. Some have all the comforts of home such as big-screen TVs, poker tables, king-size beds and stereo systems. They can have refrigerators, fireplaces and bathrooms with hot showers. Many ice fishermen spend weekends in their comfortable ice shack retreats all winter. 
In the northern parts of North America, ice fishing is often a social activity. Some resorts have fish houses that are rented out by the day; often, shuttle service by Snow Track or other vehicles modified to drive on ice is provided. They can appear to a city on the ice where fishing is best. Some even elect a mayor. Most municipalities have requirements to remove ice houses by a certain date before the ice melts.
In Finland, peace and quiet in is often the object of the pastime. In Finland, fish houses are a rare. But wearing a sealed and insulated dry suit designed with space age fabric is not.

Splatoon

Splatoon (Japanese: スプラトゥーン, Hepburn: Supuratūn) 
 
 is a third-person shooter video game. It was developed by Nintendo EAD Group No. 2 and published by Nintendo. The game was released on May 28, 2015 in Japan, May 29, 2015 in Europe, May 29, 2015 in North America, and on May 30, 2015 in Australia. It was released for the Wii U. In "Splatoon", the player controls a character called an Inkling. They can change between human and squid forms. The object of the game is to shoot colored ink across the game's map and cover the most territory with their team's color before the match ends. By transforming into a squid, it lets players swim through their own colored ink and can even let the player swim up walls and through grates. Hiding in their own ink recharges the players ink supply.
Nintendo announced that a series of Splatoon Amiibo figures would be released along with the game, Boy and Girl Inklings are sold separately and a Squid figure is sold only as a bundle with either the game or the two other Amiibos. People who pre-ordered "Splatoon" at GameStop were given a download voucher that gave them Splatoon-themed Mii costumes to use in "Super Smash Bros. For Wii U".
Reception.
"Splatoon" was met with positive reviews. GamesRadar rated the game a 3.5 out of 5 stars. They said that the game was a refreshing take on the shooter genre but criticized some of the features like lobbies and Amiibo-locked content. Destructoid rated the game 8.5. Chris Carter of Destructoid, said that "most of (the game's) shortcomings can be forgiven in my mind because of how damn fun it is."

1948 Palestine War

The 1948 Palestine War, also known as the War of Independence to Israelis and the nakba (disaster in Arabic) to Palestinians, was a war between the new state of Israel, Palestinian Arabs, and the states around Israel. The war actually began in 1947 following the announcement of the end of the British Mandate in Palestine (British control of the region) and the division of the territory into two equal-sized countries. By the end of the war in 1949 Israel had expanded its territory beyond the borders it was given. Additionally, the Arab state created in the UN Partition Plan never came into being as its two largest sections of land, the Gaza Strip (small piece of land southern Palestine on the coast) and the West Bank (region east of Jerusalem and west of the Jordan River), passed into the control of neighboring Egypt and Jordan respectively. The war continues to be a hotly-contested issue in the Eastern Mediterranean today. For Israelis, it represents the change from the Yishuv, the Jewish Community of Palestine, to the state of Israel (hence the War of Independence). Other countries have had to address the idea of defeat and the difficulties of regional diplomacy (caused by the creation of a unique Jewish State in a mostly Arab-cultural region. For Palestinians, of whom nearly 720,000 left the region as refugees, the war is remembered as the nakba, the war that broke up a growing nation and pushed its people away.
Background.
Jewish settlement.
Beginning in 1881, European Jews began to move in large numbers from Europe and leave for Palestine. Predominantly, these new immigrants settled in the region under the banner of Jewish nationalism, known as Zionism. This nationalist movement had as its goal the creation of a Jewish state. Although at first friendly, relations between Arabs in Palestine and Jews from Europe became more bitter as the number of Jews moving grew. 
Palestinian Nationalism and the Great Revolt.
During World War One, these two populations, Arabs and Jews, were under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. To weaken the Empire, her enemies (Britain and France), began to offer land to peoples in sections of the Empire for launching resistance to the Ottomans. This included offering Palestine to various Arab leaders (including the Husayn family of Saudi Arabia). At the same time, the British offered control of Palestine to a Jewish state that didn't yet exist. Although this action came to nothing, it still encouraged greater movement of Jews to Palestine as well as a fear of losing regional control for the Palestinians. In 1936, responding to the growing Jewish population, Palestinian Arabs led an armed revolt against the British and Jews in Palestine. The revolt, led by the mufti and head of the Arab Higher Committee Hajj Amin al-Husayni, was the first large-scale expression of a sense of Palestinian nationalism. Though it ended with the British and Jews putting down the revolt, the resulting White Paper of 1939 proved it had been an influential piece of resistance. Under the 1939 White Paper, Jews could only send a further 75,000 immigrants over 5 years and the goal of giving over Israel to Palestine. This situation, two cultures competing against each other for Palestine, continued to be the case throughout World War Two. At the end of that conflict, the British Mandate in Palestine was near ending and the peoples of the region wanted a solution to the issue.
UN Resolution.
In 1947, the British gave the issue of competing peoples within Palestine to the United Nations. The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine was tasked with fizing the issue of violence between the two groups and treating each side with fairness in the giving-out of land. On November 29, 1947, the Partition Plan was announced. Palestine would be divided into separate Jewish and Arab states of roughly equal size. Jerusalem would remain an independent city run by the UN. Finally, the British would leave the Mandate of Palestine by May 1948. At first, most of the international community supported the plan (including both the USA and USSR) as well as the Yishuv. Palestinian Arabs, as well as the nations of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Transjordan (now Jordan) argued against the plan and pushed for a new one with an Arab state and a recognized Jewish minority. When that was not accepted, these nations moved for war by raising armies to fight the new state of Israel.
Armed forces.
Jewish Community (Israel after May 15, 1948).
Given its recent status as a state, the Yishuv actually had one of the most well-organized and well-armed military forces in the region. This force fell under the control of the Haganah, a single state army and the army that would become the modern Israeli Defense Force (IDF)(the switch was made in late May 1948). By mid-May, the state of Israel had called up an army of 35,000. As the war continued into July, that number trended up to 65,000. At the end of the war, Israel had successfully brought up and armed 96,441 men to fight against the Palestinians and Arab nations. Additionally, Israel was unique for having a developed strategic plan and a simple command system. Under the leadership of David Ben-Gurion, the minister of defense, the state of Israel could count on a force with unified leadership and a plan.
Palestinian Forces.
Unlike the Yishuv, the Palestinians had no unified force before the war began in late 1947. There were several paramilitary groups, but no single leader, structure or plan. Al-Husayni and the Arab Higher Committee tried to give the fighters a system. Yet, many disliked his leadership and did not think of the Committee as the voice of Palestinians. Still, al-Husayni successfully created a rag-tag force known as the Holy War Army made up of new volunteers and paramilitary forces. This army and the other Palestinian fighters, however, lacked modern weapons and supplies. Though al-Husayni pushed the Arab League (a collection of majority Arab nations) for greater support and control to direct the course of the war, the League blocked him.
Arab League Forces.
The nations of the Arab League that joined in the war against Israel were Egypt, Transjordan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria (there was a smaller force from Saudi Arabia and Yemen under Egyptian command). Despite having the League to bind them, at the start of the war there was no single League commander. Each country mobilized its own force for its own goals. The force was thus not one League force but a collection of forces. The final force from the Arab League, the Arab Liberation Army, was a force of 4,000 volunteers from across the Middle East which worked out of Syria. While the nations of the Arab League surrounded Israel, they did so as different countries.
Objectives.
Yishuv/Israel.
Israel’s objectives for the war were originally based on the Haganah’s 1946 Plan and run by David Ben-Gurion. The plan called for the rapid build-up of forces to fight against what the army saw as the greatest threat: invasion from the many Arab states. By using the 1946 Plan, Ben-Gurion hoped to secure the land given to Israel in the UN Partition Plan. As the war went on, the goals changed slightly with the introduction in March 1948 of Plan Dalet (Plan D). Instead of simply holding the lands given to Israel, the plan now commanded Israel’s forces to work remove Arabs from Jewish-controlled land, defend Jewish settlements in Arab Palestine, and to take Arab land at particular positions for a strategic advantage. A possible reason for the change is given by historian David Tal, who points out that it was probably a response to the stiffer resistance from Palestinians and a general desire to put Israeli forces in the most defensible positions. Yet, as Tal also points out, this strategic plan has never been without some controversy, particularly the part of the plan which forced Palestinian movement. 
Palestine.
The principal objective for the Palestinians, as expressed by the Arab Higher Committee, was the creation of a single Arab state in Palestine.
Transjordan/Jordan.
While Transjordan outwardly agreed with the rest of the Arab League in creating an Arab state in Palestine, that seems to have not been Transjordan’s ultimate goal. According to the records of Transjordan, King Abdullah, Transjordan’s Hashemite (royal family) monarch, was interested in using the war as an excuse to put Palestinian Arabs under Jordanian control. This would then put him into a position to seize Syria and create a Greater Syria. This means that Transjordan’s objectives were seemingly in opposition to those Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and the Palestinians themselves.
Syria and Egypt.
Like Transjordan, both Syria and Egypt supported creating a single Arab state in Palestine. Their reasoning, however, was more about stopping the spread of Jordanan, who both nations feared (should Transjordan take the region).
Course of the War.
Phase 1: The Civil War.
The first part of the conflict pitted the Yishuv’s forces against those of the Palestinian’s Arab Higher Committee. The civil war began with three days of strikes on November 30, 1947. It then changed into a guerrilla campaign against Jewish supply trucks. In January 1948, the Arab Liberation Army entered Palestine. This stiff resistance caused the Israelis to adapt their plan and to introduce Plan Dalet. On April 5th, the Haganah launched Operation Nahshon, a fifteen day operation to secure routes to Jerusalem by seizing hills along the main roads. After the success of Operation Nahshon and smaller Jewish offensives, Palestinian resistance began to fall apart.
Phase 2: The Arab League countries invade.
The second part of the war began with the invasion of Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Lebanon, and Syria in May 1948. Each invasion force basically entered Palestine on the nearest border. Fighting in the West Bank and around Jerusalem dominated this phase of the war. Jewish forces moved into Jerusalem to secure the western section of the city. To shore up this position, Israeli forces also tried to take Latrun, a hill to the north of Jerusalem. This proved unsuccessful. In other areas, the Israelis found greater success. Two Egyptian forces, one moving along the coast and the other across the Negev towards Jerusalem, were both halted. The Iraqi force was pushed back. Though Syrian and Lebanese forces made an advance into Israeli territories, Israelis made counter advances into Syrian and Lebanese territory. Fighting was brought to an end by a UN truce on June 11.
Phase 3: Israeli Push Against Transjordans.
On July 9th, the Israelis launched a new series of operations against the Jordanians in the West Bank. The hope was to end the conflict in this front against what Israelis considered to be the most well-trained and armed Arab army, Transjordan’s Arab Legion. The offensives were largely a success and although other Arab nations tried to take advantage of Israel’s focus on the West Bank, their advances were small. This phase of the war ended with another truce on July 18, 1948.
Phase 4: Israeli push against Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon.
With the Jordanians stuck in the West Bank, Israelis launched two more offensives on October 15th. These forced Egyptian forces out of the Negev Desert and pushed back Syrian and Lebanese forces into their own countries. Following these last offensives, the military part of the war ended. Still, it would take until January 7, 1949 for Israel to complete signing treaties with each warring nation.
Results.
Through the war, Israel gained a large amount of land. While the original separation lines gave about equal land to Jewish and Arab states, the treaty lines of 1949 gave Israel a much larger state, limiting Arab-controlled land to the small Gaza strip and a smaller West Bank (than in 1947. Yet, these were not controlled by any Palestinian government. Instead, Egypt controlled the small Gaza Strip while Jordan controlled the West Bank and Eastern Jerusalem.
An additional aspect to the aftermath of the war was the Palestinian refugee crisis. By the end of the war, there were approximately 720,000 refugees living in camps in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Although much of this can be attributed to war-time fear, some historians, like James Gelvin, assert that Israeli policy in Plan Dalet partially contributed to this crisis. The policy, which encouraged Israeli forces to seize Arab property in Jewish territory, exacerbated the refugee issue. As of 2015, the right of these refugees to return to their former homes or to receive reparations remains uncertain.

The Weddell seal is a seal that is common in Antarctica. It is named after James Weddell, who discovered it. Estimations are that there are half a million to a million of these animals left, which makes it the most common seal in Antarctica, after the Crabeater seal. During the winter, most Weddel seals do not migrate northwards. Instead, they keep open a hole in the ice, by gnawing it with their teeth.

Rational root theorem

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
The Rational root theorem (or rational zero theorem) is a proven idea in mathematics. It says that if the coefficients of a polynomial are integers, then one can find all of the possible rational roots by dividing each factor of the leading coefficient by each factor of the constant term. [1][2]
Think about this polynomial:
anxn + an-1xn-1 + an-2xn-2 + … + a0
All of the possible rational roots are these: ±factors of an / ±factors of a0
This only finds the rational roots. There may be imaginary roots. Other theorems, such as Descartes’ rule of signs, help find how many imaginary roots there are for a given equation. [1]
Example.
Think about this polynomial: 15x4 + 2x3 – 10x2 + x – 8
Factors of the leading coefficient are: 15: ±1,±3,±5,±15
Factors of the constant are: -8: ±1,±2,±4,±8
Possible rational roots are: ±1/1,±1/2,±1/4,±1/8,±3/1,±3/2,±3/4,±3/8,±5/1,±5/2,±5/4,±5/8,±15/1,±15/2,±15/4,±15/8

Bodrum Castle

Bodrum Castle (Turkish: "Bodrum Kalesi" 
 
), formerly the Castle of St. Peter, is located in southwest Turkey in the port city of Bodrum (Coordinates: ), was built from 1402 onwards, by the Knights Hospitaller as the "Castle of St. Peter" or "Petronium". The castle was completed in 1522. It was used as a jail in 19th century. There are 5 towers of Bodrum Castle.
History.
The headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller were on the island of Rhodes. In 1402 their fortifications at İzmir fell to the Mongols under Tamerlane. Threatened by an invasion of the Seljuks they built the castle at Bodrum. Its location was the site of a fortification during the Doric Greek period. There was also a small Seljuk castle in the 11th century. The same promontory is also the probable site of the palace of Mausolos. He was the king of Caria. The construction of the castle began in 1404. It was fully fortified by 1460. Bodrum came under its final siege in 1522. At the time it was still strong enough to send men to Rhodes. After Rhodes fell, the castle surrendered.
Museum of Underwater Archaeology.
The Museum of Underwater Archaeology is housed inside the castle. One of its displays is one of the world's oldest ships believed to come from the 6th century. Another is called the glass shipwreck due to the large number of bottles it was carrying.

Tubo-ovarian abscess

A tubo-ovarian abscess is an infection of the female ovary and fallopian tube. It is a pus-filled ovary and Fallopian tube that is filled with infection. This type of abscess is caused by an untreated sexually transmitted disease. It can be a a complication after surgery to remove the uterus.:103
When a woman has this abcess, she has a fever, signs of infection in her blood, severe pain in her pelvic area. She may also have a vaginal discharge. Many different kinds of bacteria can cause tubo-ovarian abscess. Tubo-ovarian abscess is rare in virgins.
Symptoms and causes.
The symptoms of tubo-ovarian abscess are the same as pelvic inflammatory disease. The abscess can be seen with x-rays and other medical equipment. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can cause tubo-ovarian abscess. The microorganism that causes a Chlamidia infection can cause tubo-ovarian abscess. Other bacteria can cause tubo-ovarian absess Using an IUD for a long time can cause TOA.
The abcess can rupture filling the abdomen with the infection. This is an emergency and a woman can die if this ruptured abscess is not treated quickly. A blood infection can happen if the abscess is not treated.:103 Sometimes an inter uteran device, a form of birth control can cause the abcess.
Prevention and treatment.
Some things make a woman more likely to get this disease. These things are: sexual activity, increased age, IUD insertion, chlamydia infection, bacterial infection, sexually transmitted disease. This disease is cured by treatment with medicine that will kill the bacteria that are causing the infection. Some doctors will use intravenous antibiotics for least 24 hours. Some women with this infection have to go to the hospital. Sometimes surgery has to be done. After being in the hospital, medicine can be taken by mouth that will continue to cure the infection.:103 Patients are checked by a doctor three days after being in the hospital.

First Dynasty of Egypt

The First Dynasty of ancient Egypt were the first group of Egyptian kings to rule over a united country. It began when Upper and Lower Egypt were joined as a single country, probably by Narmer. It is the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. At this time Thinis was the centre of power.
Historians argue about the dates of the First Dynasty which was part of the Early Bronze Age. They use a number of different ways to decide on the dates for events in Egypt. It began sometime between 3400 and 3000 BC. In 2013 radiocarbon dating showed that Hor-Aha began ruling between 3218–3035 BC.
Rulers.
Known rulers of the First Dynasty:
Information about the First Dynasty comes from monuments and other objects with royal names. The most important are the Narmer palette, the Narmer Macehead and the Den and Qa'a king lists. No details of the dynasty have been found except for brief entry on the Palermo Stone. Manetho's book, "Aegyptiaca" is different to the archeological evidence and other historical records. Manetho names nine rulers of the First Dynasty, but only one name matches the other sources. He only has information for four of them. The hieroglyphs were fully developed and would be used with little change for more than 3000 years.
Large tombs for pharaohs have been found at Abydos and Naqada. There are also cemeteries at Saqqara and Helwan near Memphis. These had buildings of wood and mud bricks, with some small use of stone for walls and floors. Stone was used for making ornaments, vessels, and sometimes for statues. Tamarix – tamarisk, salt cedar was used to build boats such as the Abydos Boats. They invented the ﬁxed Mortise and tenon joint. A ﬁxed tenon was made by shaping the end of one timber to ﬁt into a mortise (hole) that is cut into a second timber. A variation of this joint, using a free tenon, became one of the most important features in Mediterranean and Egyptian shipbuilding. It joined two pieces of wood by putting a separate tenon into a hole (mortise) of the same size cut into each piece.
Human sacrifice.
Human sacrifice was part of the burials for all the pharaohs of the First Dynasty. Servants were buried near each pharaoh's tomb, as well as animals. There are 338 people buried at the tomb of Djer. The people and animals sacrificed, such as donkeys, would help the pharaoh in the afterlife. For unknown reasons, this practice ended with this dynasty. Later burials had shabtis (small figures like dolls) taking the place of actual people.

<doc id="505426" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505426" title="Manetho">
Manetho

Manetho was an ancient Egyptian historian and priest from Sebennytos. He lived during the Ptolemaic era, in about 300 BC.
Manetho wrote the "Aegyptiaca" ("History of Egypt"). His book is used by Egyptologists to work out the dates for events in ancient Egypt. The earliest reference to Manetho's "Aegyptiaca" is in Jewish historian Josephus's book, "Against Apion".
Name.
We do not know what Manetho's name means, some suggestions are "Gift of Thoth", "Beloved of Thoth", "Truth of Thoth", "Beloved of Neith", or "Lover of Neith", "Myinyu-heter" ("Horseherd" or "Groom") and "Ma'ani-Djehuti" ("I have seen Thoth"). 
Life and work.
We do not know when he was born or died. His book may have been written during the rule of Ptolemy I Soter (323–283 BC) and Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BC). The "Hibeh Papyri", dated to 241/40 BC, suggests he may been writing during the rule of Ptolemy III Euergetes (246–222 BC). He wrote in the Greek language. Other works he wrote include "Against Herodotus", "The Sacred Book", "On Antiquity and Religion", "On Festivals", "On the Preparation of Kyphi", and the "Digest of Physics". The "Book of Sothis" on astrology, may also be written by him. 
He was probably a priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis. He knew a lot about the cult of Sarapis based on Osiris and Apis). Sarapis was a Greco-Macedonian version of the Egyptian cult dating back to Alexander the Great. Tacitus and Plutarch wrote that Ptolemy (probably Ptolemy Soter) imported a statue of the god.
"Aegyptiaca".
The "Aegyptiaca", the "History of Egypt", may have been Manetho's largest work. It was in date order and divided into three volumes. In "Aegyptiaca", he invented the word "dynasty" to mean a group of kings with a common origin. It came from the Greek word "dynasteia", meaning "governmental power". He was the first person to group the rulers into dynasties. He did not use the word to mean families. He began a new dynasty when there was a break or change in the power of government. For example there was a break between the Fourth Dynasty in Memphis, and the Fifth Dynasty at Elephantine. He included details of many of the kings.
"Aegyptiaca" may have been written as an Egyptian history, to be more accurate than Herodotus' "Histories". Hiis other book, "Against Herodotus", may be just have been a short version of "Aegyptiaca". There are no original copies of either book.
Copies of the book.
"Aegyptiaca" has not survived as a complete book. It is very possible that what has been kept was rewritten by other writers to support their Egyptian, Jewish, or Greek histories. This makes it difficult for modern historians to know how reliable it is a a history.
The earliest mention of Manetho is in Josephus' "Contra Apionem" ("Against Apion"). This was written nearly 400 years after "Aegyptiaca". It is clear that Josephus did not have the original of Manethos' book. At about the same time, a short version, the Epitome, of the book was being used. This kept Manetho's brief list of dynasties and a some parts that were seen as important. For example it had that the first Dynasty, Menes, "was snatched and killed by a hippopotamus". It is not known if any of the short version is Manetho's original writing. Copies were written by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius of Caesarea. Eusebius's copy was used by Jerome in his Latin translation, an Armenian translation, and by George Syncellus. Syncellus saw that the copies by Eusebius and Africanus were almost the same, so he placed them side by side in his work, "Ecloga Chronographica".
These last four copies are the only copies of the epitome of Manetho. Other sections are in Malalas's "Chronographia" and "Excerpta Latina Barbari" ("Excerpts in Bad Latin").
Sources and methods.
Manetho used lists of kings to provide a structure for his history. Josephus wrote that Manetho also used stories, myths and legends for his book. This was common among historians of that time. He must have known the Greek work of Herodotus. He tried to link Egyptian history with Greek history. For example, he links King Memnon with Amenophis, and Armesis with Danaos). It is possible that these links may have been the work of later writers. We do know he could write in the Greek language.
King lists.
The king-list that Manetho used is unknown. The Turin King List is the one that is the most similar. The oldest source to compare with Manetho are the "Old Kingdom Annals" (c. 2500-2200 BC). There are also the Karnak king list, two at Abydos and the Saqqara list.
The "Old Kingdom Annals" only survive on the Palermo Stone. There are many differences between the stone and Manetho. The stone stops at the fifth dynasty. It includes the early kings of Lower Egypt and kings of Upper Egypt. Manetho lists several Greek and Egyptian gods beginning with Hephaistos and Helios. The "Annals" also give annual reports of the activities of the kings.
The New Kingdom lists left out some rulers. The list prepared for Seti I, has 76 kings from the First Dynasties to the Fourteenth, but leave out the Hyksos rulers and those linked to Akhenaten. The Saqqara list also does not include them in its list of 58 names. These names were left out for religious, rather than political reasons. If Manetho used these lists at all, he would have been unable to get all of his information from them.
The Turin King List was probably a government, rather than a religious document. It would not have needed to leave out kings for religious reasons. These sort of documents must have been available to Manetho. As a priest he would have had access to all written materials in the temple.
Manetho's list was probably from Lower Egypt. He included kings from the Third Intermediate Period, even such short-lived kings like Amenemnisu (5 years) and Osochor (6 years). But he left out the kings from Thebes, such as Osorkon III, Takelot III, Harsiese A and Pinedjem I and kings from Middle Egypt like Peftjaubast of Herakleopolis. Manetho's information must have come from a local city's temple library in the River Nile Delta. The Middle and Upper Egyptian Pharaohs did not control this part of the Delta; which is why they are left out of Manetho's king-list.
Names.
By the Middle Kingdom, Egyptian kings each had five different names. These were the "Horus" name; the "Two Ladies" name; the "Gold Horus" name; the "praenomen" or "throne name"; and a "nomen", the personal name given at birth (also called a "Son of Ra" name as it was preceded by "Sa Re'"). Some Pharaohs also had more than one of these names. For example Ramesses II used six Horus names at various times. We do not know if Manetho knew about the different names of rulers long past. Not all the different names for each king have been discovered, and it maybe that the kings were known by other names as well as the official names. Because Manetho translated the names into Greek, we do not know the original Egyptian name.
Content.
Volume 1 begins from the earliest times. It lists gods and demigods as kings of Egypt. Stories of Isis, Osiris, Set, or Horus might have been found here. The book then lists kings from the First Dynasty I to the Eleventh Dynasty. This would have included the Old Kingdom, the First Intermediate Period, and the early Middle Kingdom.
Volume 2 covers Twelfth Dynasty to the Nineteenth. This includes the end of the Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period (XV–XVII—the Hyksos invasion), and the start of the New Kingdom. Josephus believed the Hyksos or "shepherd-kings" were the ancient Israelites who made their way out of Egypt ("Apion" 1.82–92). 
Volume 3 starts with the Twentieth Dynasty and ends with the Thirtieth.
Effect of "Aegyptiaca".
Egyptologists still use Manetho's way of grouping the pharaohs into dynasties. The French explorer and Egyptologist, Jean-François Champollion, had a copy of Manetho's lists to help him read the hieroglyphs. Modern histories now use both the modern translation of names and Manetho's version.

Vaginal flora

Vaginal flora or microbiota are tiny microorganisms that are part of the healthy reproductive organs in a woman. Humans have many very small organisms that are a normal part of the human body. These microorgansims can only be seen with a microscope. These organisms are bacteria and fungi. Almost all of them do not cause sickness, but it is still normal to have them inside or outside the body. 
These small microorganisms are called microbiota by researchers. There are microbiota in the stomach, the skin, the mouth, the eyes, and microbiota in the vagina. The microbiota in humans help to stop infections caused by other bacteria. Vaginal microbiota help keep the vagina healthy. They help prevent infection caused other bacteria. Bacteria that cause sickness or infection are called pathogens. The normal vaginal microbiota stop pathogens from growing.
When a woman sees a doctor because she has fluid coming out of her vagina, the doctor might test the woman for bacteria pathogens. Pathogens can grow too fast. They can grow faster than the normal and healthy vaginal microbiota. An infection can make fluid come out of the vagina. This is called vaginal discharge. A good and healthy bacteria that keeps the vagina free from sickness is called Lactobacillus. There other good bacteria that keep the vagina healthy. Some of their names are: Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Actinomyces.
If a woman catches a sexually transmitted disease, it will change the vaginal microbiota. The healthy vaginal microbiota can not stop or cure a sexually transmitted infection.

The story usually takes place in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India. It moved to Punjab, India for a month in April 2014. This was because the story jumped ahead 20 years to tell about the life of Asad and Zoya's daughter, Sanam. Production was back in Bhopal in May 2014, because Sanam went back to the city where her mother and father lived.

Molly Pitcher

Molly Pitcher is the name given to a legendary Revolutionary War heroine. There is no record of a real person named "Molly Pitcher" in Revolutionary war records. Most historians agree it was a nickname for a person doing a particular job. It is thought the name came from a soldier's cry for a pitcher of water to drink or to cool their overheated cannons. Molly was a common woman's nickname at the time.
History of the legend.
Stories about the American Revolution were first told by word of mouth. This allowed the storyteller to exaggerate or even invent history. The stories keep being told today even though recent scholarship has proved they are not authentic. Molly Pitcher is a composite of more than one person. A great many women helped soldiers on the battlefields during the Revolutionary war. Most were wives and children of soldiers. According to the legend, "Molly Pitcher" took over the firing of a cannon after her husband was wounded. The Battle of Monmouth is the most likely source for the rise of the legend. Her story was started many years after the war by writers and artists. A Currier and Ives print of a "Captain Molly" appeared in 1848. The first written mention of Molly Pitcher didn't appear until 1859. It wasn't until 1876 that someone published a genealogy claiming a local woman was the real Molly Pitcher. After that the cult of Molly Pitcher grew and grew.
The candidates.
There is often a kernel of truth in every legend. Molly Pitcher is no exception. Molly Pitcher is as popular as ever and has found her way into grade-school and high-school textbooks. Many other sources just repeat one version or another of the legend. Internet sources even argue whether Molly Pitcher was a feminist. There are several women whose story may make up a part of the Mary Pitcher legend:
Molly Pitcher was not just one person. She was inspired by the actions of several Revolutionary War women who made real contributed to the effort. They served in many capacities with patriotism and courage. The Revolutionary war was more a war of small skirmishes than full scale battles. It was not at all unusual for women to be drawn into a battles. Women filled many roles traditionally thought of as being filled only by men.
A written account.
Joseph Plumb Martin was a soldier in the Continental Army. He kept a narrative of his experiences. This came to the attention of historians in the 1950s. Martin describes an incident at the Battle of Monmouth involving an unnamed woman:
 This account has been changed in other sources to show he gave her a name when in fact he did not.

Marksmanship Ribbon

 
A Marksmanship Ribbon is an award by the United States Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. It is awarded to service members who achieve an above-average score on a weapons qualification course. Also, there are select State National Guard organizations that award marksmanship ribbons for high placement in state-level marksmanship competitions.
Navy.
The U.S. Navy has issued two marksmanship ribbons: the "Navy Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon" and "Navy Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon", since 1920. The pistol ribbon is awarded for qualification on the Beretta M9 9mm pistol. The rifle ribbon is awarded for qualification on the M14 and [M16 rifle]] variants.
The Navy issues the marksmanship ribbon in three levels — that of Marksman, Sharpshooter, and Expert. The basic ribbon is awarded for the Marksman level. The specific Marksmanship Device is awarded for qualification as a Sharpshooter or Expert. Those receiving an Expert qualification receive the Marksmanship Medal in addition to the Marksmanship Ribbon.
Between 1942 and 1960, the Navy also issued ribbons known as the Distinguished Marksmanship Ribbons. These awards were declared wikt:obsolete by 1965.
Air Force.
The United States Air Force awards a single ribbon, known as the "Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon". It is for expert qualification on either the M-16 rifle, M-4 carbine or the individuals AFSC's (duty) designated pistol. The ribbon is issued in only one degree. But, a bronze service star may be worn on the ribbon for those who have qualified expert on both the service rifle and pistol. The ribbon was authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force on Aug. 28, 1962. It was awarded to all Air Force service members who qualified after Jan. 1, 1963. Prior to the ribbon, Air Force members were awarded with the United States Air Force Small Arms Marksmanship Certificate of Achievement (AF Form 1193 Jan 1961).
Coast Guard.
The Coast Guard Marksmanship Ribbons are issued under the same criteria as the U.S. Navy. But Coast Guardsmen use a .40 cal SIG Sauer P229R DAK pistol instead of the Navy's M9 pistol. The Coast Guard issues two ribbons. they are known as the "Coast Guard Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon" and the "Coast Guard Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon". The Marksmanship Device is awarded for qualification at the higher levels of sharpshooter and expert. Like the Navy, for those who receive an expert qualification, the Marksmanship Medal is awarded instead of the Marksmanship Ribbon.
National Guard.
Once a year, thousands of Army and Air National Guard shooters (champion marksmanship teams from each state) compete against each other at the Winston P. Wilson Rifle and Pistol Championships. In the Missouri National Guard, the top twelve guardsmen selected to represent their state at the Winston P. Wilson matches are awarded the Governor's Twelve Ribbon. This is worn on dress uniforms. Any guardsman who earns the award more than once wear Hawthorn Cluster Device(s) on top of the ribbon. In addition, these guardsman are awarded the Governor's Twelve Tab for wear on the combat uniform.
Similarly, the Adjutant General of Missouri awards the Adjutant General's Twenty Ribbon to soldiers and airmen. It is awarded to those who qualify among the top twenty competitors at the Missouri State Combat Matches conducted each year. They are the top eight combat rifle shooters, the top eight pistol shooters, the top two light machine gun teams, and the top two scout/sniper teams. In addition to this ribbon, these guardsman are also awarded the Adjutant General's Twenty Combat Badge for wear on the combat uniform.
Guardsmen are authorized to wear these ribbons as a permanent decoration on service dress uniforms, to the left of federal awards, when operating under Title 32 (state control) status. When federalized (Title 10), guardsman cannot wear these ribbons until they return to Title 32 status.
Additional Information.
The U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps provide Weapons Qualification Badges instead of a Marksmanship Ribbon. For the services that award the Marksmanship Ribbon, re-qualification is not necessary once a service member has obtained the award. The ribbon may be worn throughout an individual's career. In the Navy and Coast Guard, the Marksmanship Ribbon may be upgraded with a Marksmanship Device if a higher qualification is achieved.

She was 15 years old when this happened. Colvin was put on trial on several charges including violating the segregation ordinance. The court found her guilty. Colvin was placed on probation. In 1956, about one year after Colvin refused to give up her seat, her lawyer, Fred Gray, filed the landmark federal lawsuit: Browder v Gayle. This case stopped segregation on public transportation in Montgomery Alabama. Around this time, Colvin was getting involved in the Youth Council of Montgomery of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).Even though the got a light sentence from the court, she was branded a troublemaker. She dropped out of college and could not find a job. Colvin moved to New York City in 1958. There she worked as a nurse assistant in a nursing home while living there. Colvin retired in 2004.

TAT-1

TAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first submarine transatlantic telephone cable system. It was laid between Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland. Two cables were laid between 1955 and 1956. One cable for each direction. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956. The cable was able to carry 35 simultaneous telephone calls. A 36th channel was used to carry up to 22 telegraph lines.
History.
The first transatlantic telegraph cable had been laid in 1858 (see Cyrus West Field). It only operated for a month, but was replaced with a successful connection in 1866. A radio-based transatlantic telephone service was started in 1927. It charged £9 for three minutes. A telephone cable was discussed at that time. But it was not practical until a number of technological advances arrived in the 1940s.
The developments that made TAT-1 possible were coaxial cable, polyethylene insulation, very reliable vacuum tubes for the submerged repeaters and an improvement in carrier equipment. Transistors were not used, being a recent invention of unknown longevity.

James Armistead Lafayette

 
James Armistead Lafayette (December 10, 1760 – August 9, 1830) was an African American slave. He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War as a double agent. He served under the Marquis de Lafayette. He reported on the activities of Benedict Arnold after he had gone over to the British. He also reported on Lord Cornwallis just before the Battle of Yorktown. James gave the British false information on the Americans.
Life and career.
He was an African-American slave. He was owned by William Armistead of Virginia. James took his master's name and called himself James Armistead. James was born about 1748 in Virginia.
After getting the consent of his master, he volunteered in 1781 to join the American army under the Marquis de Lafayette. The Marquis used him as a spy. Armistead posed as a runaway slave to the British. He joined the camp of Brigadier General Benedict Arnold the turncoat who was leading some British forces in the area. Pretending to be a spy for the British, Armistead gained Arnold's trust. Arnold used him to guide British troops through local roads. "The ex-slave, who later renamed himself James Armistead Lafayette in the general's honor, served as a double agent against the british under the avowedly antislavery Lafayette." 
After Arnold departed north in the spring of 1781, James went to the camp of Lord Charles Cornwallis. Again he posed as a runaway slave. He was given a job serving General Cornwallis. He moved frequently between British camps. In each case the officers would speak openly about their strategies in front of him. James kept this information in written reports. He gave these reports to other American spies. In this way he relayed much information about the British plans for troop movements and about their weapons. Cornwallis hired James to spy for the British. When he was sent to spy on the Americans he brought back an order for General Daniel Morgan to bring up all his reserves. Morgan didn't have any reserves, it was a false order. But it kept Cornwallis where he was leading to his defeat at the Battle of Yorktown. The intelligence reports from his espionage were also instrumental in helping to defeat the British.
After the war.
After the war James had to return to his live as a slave. He was not eligible for emancipation under the Act of 1783 for slave-soldiers. Spies were not considered soldiers. When Lafayette returned to Virginia in 1784 he found out that James was still a slave. 
The Marquis de Lafayette wrote a letter to the Virginia legislature praising James and what he did. This won James his freedom and a pension. James took the name James Armistead Lafayette.
James, now James Armistad Lafayette, bought forty acres of land in Virginia and began farming. He married and had a large family. He died August 9, 1830 in New Kent county, Virginia.

Trait

This page is about traits in biology. For other uses of the term, see Trait (disambiguation).
A trait or character in biology is a feature of a living thing. It is part of an organism's phenotype.
Every living thing, from tiny organisms like bacteria, to plants, animals and humans, has some characteristics which make it special. Thus an elephant has tusks, large size and weight, large ears and very large molar teeth (et cetera). These are typical characters of the African and Indian elephants. 
Biologists call those "traits". The living thing is built in a certain way; this is its "anatomy", its structure or body. The physical structure "works" in a certain way; this is its function, the way its body works. An animal also "acts" in a certain way; this is its behaviour. 
The way that a living thing is structured, the way its body works and the way that it acts are all traits. The basic traits are shared by all the members of the group, "that is why they are put in the same group". Other traits are only shared by a small number of the group. 
For example: 
Traits are heritable: they can be passed on from one generation to the next by genes. Mendel's work involved the inheritance of traits on pea plants. The whole group of traits of an organism is its phenotype.
Trait versus character.
Different sources use the term differently. 'Trait' competes with the term 'character'. 
Synonyms.
According to some authorities, trait and character are synonyms:
'Trait' as a sub-character.
Some sources use both terms:
This works well with Mendelian characters. In such cases, a character is a feature of a species which may present as various traits. Examples:
But not all characters are inherited in the simple manner of Mendel's pea characters. For example, an animal's weight is a character, but many genes contribute to it, and so does the animal's environment from birth. Weight is a) continuous rather than discrete (separate steps), b) polygenic (controlled by a number of genes), and c) because weight is influenced by both heredity and environment. 
Only 'character' used.
To avoid this issue, some sources use only the term character. Futuyma uses this system for Mendelian characters:
This use of 'character state' allows Futuyma to use terms such as 'ancestral state' and 'derived state' when talking about the evolution of characters.

Shallot

Shallots are a type of onion. They are a botanical variety of the species "Allium cepa". The shallot was previously classified as a separate species, "A. ascalonicum".
Growth.
Shallots seldom produce seeds. They are increased by dividing its compound bulbs. These are is made up of several bulblets or cloves held together at the base. The bulblets are planted the same as onion sets. Each set develops into a compound set. The mature bulbs are harvested, cured and stored the same way as onions. In suitable storage, the bulbs keep from one season to the next. 
Flavour.
The flavor of shallots is a little milder than onions. The chief uses it for flavoring curries. Both leaves and cloves are used. Leaves are also consumed as green vegetables. Like their cousin`s onions and garlics, this is also considered as non-vegetarian food in India. Most of the crop is produced for sale in the green state. But some dry bulbs are also used. They are also used for pickling.

Lories and lorikeets

Lories and lorikeets (tribe Loriini) are small to medium-sized arboreal parrots. They have special brush-tipped tongues to feed on nectar of blossoms and soft fruits, preferably berries. 
They are a monophyletic group in the parrot family Psittacidae. Sequence analysis and morphology show that the group is in the middle of other groups. 
They are widely distributed throughout the Australasian region, including south-eastern Asia, Polynesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and Australia, and the majority have very brightly coloured plumage.
Those studies show that the lories and lorikeets form a single group, closely related to the budgerigar and the fig parrots.

Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)

"Bad Blood" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song came from her fifth studio album "1989". The album version of the song only has Swift as the vocalist on verses. The single version has a different instrumental and guest vocals from rapper Kendrick Lamar on verses.
Writing and composition.
Swift wrote "Bad Blood" about an undisclosed female artist. She says that the artist attempted to sabotage one of her concert tours by hiring people that worked for her (Swift). There are rumors from "Rolling Stone", "Billboard", "Time" and "Washington Post" that singer-songwriter Katy Perry is the subject of the song. The original album version of "Bad Blood" only has Swift singing.
Commercial performance.
"Bad Blood" first charted on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 for 2 weeks in November of 2014. It also charted in January of 2015 as an album cut from "1989". It peaked at #78. After the music video premiere at the 2015 Billboard Music Awards, the remixed song with Kendrick Lamar re-entered the chart at #53 and #26 on the Digital Songs Chart. It sold over 47,000 digital copies. The song hit #1 on "Billboard" Hot 100 on the week ending May 24, 2015. It sold 385,000 copies. It became Taylor's fourth #1 single. It was also her third from "1989" (following "Shake It Off" and "Blank Space"). That made Taylor Swift the first artist since Adele to have three Hot 100 chart-toppers from the same record. It was also her fourth consecutive top-ten single from "1989".
Critical reception.
The original album version of "Bad Blood" received mixed reviews from music critics. But, the remixed version of the song received mostly positive reviews. Much of the praise was for Lamar's guest verses and the reworked instrumental. George Seabrook, writing for "The Edge" in Southampton, England, gave the song four-and-a-half stars out of five. He praised the song for "Lamar’s simple, brutally effective verses". He also said that Swift and Lamar made "not just one more meaningless stunt collaboration, but a powerful new duo".
Music video.
The music video was directed by renowned director Joseph Kahn, with Swift producing it. He had also directed the music video for "Blank Space". The video was shot in Los Angeles on April 12, 2015. The setting for the video is the City of London. The music video premiered on May 17, 2015, at the start of the Billboard Music Awards. Several friends of Swift are present in the music video, such as British singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding, American entertainer Selena Gomez, and American actresses Lena Dunham and Jessica Alba. All members of the cast chose their own names for their characters.

The volcanoes of Kamchatka are a large group of volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula. 29 active volcanoes are included in six UNESCO World Heritage List sites. They are listed as the Volcanoes of Kamchatka group, and most of them are on the Kamchatka Peninsula.
The Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160 volcanoes, including the 29 active ones. 
The highest volcano is Klyuchevskaya Sopka (4,750 m or 15,584 ft), the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The most striking is Kronotsky, whose perfect cone was said by celebrated volcanologists Robert and Barbara Decker to be a prime candidate for the world's most beautiful volcano. 
In the center of Kamchatka is Eurasia's world famous Geyser Valley which was partly destroyed by a massive mudslide in June 2007.
Deep seismic events and tsunamis are fairly common. Intense volcanism is caused by the subduction of the Pacific Plate. A pair of huge earthquakes occurred off the coast on October 16, 1737, and on November 4, 1952, in magnitudes ~9.3 and 8.2 respectively. More shallow earthquakes were recorded as recently as April 2006.

Coronavirus

Coronaviruses are viruses in the family Coronaviridae. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome. They have a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses are about 26 to 32 kilobases, extraordinarily large for an RNA virus.
The name "coronavirus" is derived from the Latin "corona", meaning crown or halo, and refers to how virions look under electron microscopy (E.M.). They have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown. This morphology is created by the viral spike (S) peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus. They decide which cells the virus can infect.
Proteins that contribute to the structure of coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N).
Diseases.
Coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds. Six different strains of coronaviruses infect humans. 
Coronaviruses are believed to cause many common colds in human adults. The significance and economic impact of coronaviruses is hard to assess. Unlike rhinoviruses (another common cold virus), human coronaviruses are difficult to grow in the laboratory.

Rhinovirus is the most common virus in humans, and the main cause of the common cold. It is called 'rhinovirus' because it infects the nose. The symptoms are very well known, and affect the whole of the upper respiratory tract, that is, the nose down to the throat. Children may get six to twelve colds a year.
The temperature most suitable for its survival is between 33 ℃ to 35 ℃. This may explain why it is found in the nose, because the nasal cavity is be open to the outside air.
There are 99 types of rhinovirus, according to their surface proteins. The rhinovirus particles are only 30nm in diameter. This is much smaller than other viruses: many are ten times larger.

Universal indicator

A universal indicator is a test to measure the pH value of a liquid. The solution that is used has many substances in it. This means that the indicator is able to show different colours (and therefore pH value ranges). The drawback of this solution is that it cannot be used for tritations, which expect a well-defined change in color.

Anti-revisionism

Anti-revisionism is opposition to attempts to modify or reject the fundamentals of communist revolutionary theory and practice. Reformism is seen as a concession to communism's adversaries.
Revisionism comes from within the Party, towards whatever is the standard policy of the Party. After Stalin's death, Krushchev's style and policies were thought by stalinists to be revisinist. The People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong and the People's Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha proclaimed themselves to be taking an anti-revisionist line and denounced Khrushchev's policies.

Matross

A matross was a soldier of artillery. He was a member of an artillery (gun) crew. A matross ranked next below a gunner. The duty of a matross was to assist the gunners in loading, firing and sponging the guns. They were armed with muskets and bayonets. They marched with the store-wagons, acting as guards. In the American army a matross ranked as a private of artillery. 
History.
Matrosses were first used in the British Army in 1639. Before that they were called gunner's assistants. In the German language a matrose means a sailor. The work assigned to the matross was considered sailor's work on a ship. It was an effort to give the assistant a respectable title. But their pay rate remained the same. In 1873 all matrosses were promoted to the rank of gunner. The rank of matross was no longer used.
A soldier's manual for artillery used by Americans in the Revolutionary war gave a detailed instruction for a matross. In part it said:
By the War of 1812 an ideal gun crew could be up to 15 men. Each man would have a specific task in the sequence of loading and firing the artillery piece. Often a non-commissioned officer would commanded the gun crew and aimed the gun. Like the other gun crew members, the matross had a specific place to stand as he performed his duties.

Comparison with Ubuntu.
deepin is based on Ubuntu and both distributions have a lot in common. Both distributions use the same software repositories. Most differences are on the desktop. Ubuntu and deepin both focus on usability, but deepin offers a different user experience (DDE) and it includes a number of applications that are not available in Ubuntu (Deepin Store).
Many popular multimedia codecs are not installed by default in deepin. deepin and many other gratis GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, do not distribute these codecs with the initial install media due to patent encumberment issues.

Fu Manchu

Dr Fu Manchu is a fictional character in novels by British author Sax Rohmer during the first half of the 20th century. 
The character was also featured extensively in cinema, television, radio, comic strips and comic books for over 90 years He has become an archetype of the evil genius. 
The author's description of him was:
A master criminal, Fu Manchu's murderous plots are marked by a use of biological warfare; he disdains guns or explosives, preferring dacoits, thuggee, and members of other secret societies as his agents armed with knives, or using "pythons and cobras ... fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli ... my black spiders" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons.
In the earliest books, Fu Manchu is an agent of the secret society, the "Si-Fan". and is the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations targeting Western imperialists. In later books, he seeks control of the Si-Fan. The Si-Fan is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and white slavery. Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the "elixir vitae" (elixir of life), a formula he spent decades trying to perfect.
Fu Manchu is opposed by a typical English detective of the Sherlock Holmes type: Denis Nayland Smith. Fu Manchu's daughter, Fah lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, plotting to usurp her father's position in the Si-Fan, and aiding his enemies within and outside of the organisation. Her real name is unknown; Fah lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment.

Wage theft

Wage theft is when employers illegally hold back money due to their workers (employees). They may withhold wages or deny benefits that are rightfully due to an employee. It is a term used in the in the United States, but the idea applies more widely. 
Examples are: failure to pay overtime, paying less than the minimum wage, illegal deductions in pay, working off the clock, or not being paid at all.
Wage theft from low wage immigrant workers is common in the United States. The Economic Policy Institute reported in 2014 that survey evidence suggests wage theft costs US workers billions of dollars a year. The rights violated by wage theft have been guaranteed to workers in the United States in the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
In February 2010 Miami-Dade County, Florida became the first jurisdiction in America to ban wage theft. Befpre that, wage theft was called "the crime wave that almost no one talks about".

Thomas Dartmouth Rice (May 20, 1808 – September 19, 1860) was an American entertainer. He developed a character called Jim Crow. Using African-American speech, song, and dance, Rice performed successfully as Jim Crow in America and England. Rice is known as the "Father of the Minstrel Show". 
Early years.
Rice was born in New York City in 1808. He had some formal schooling, and was apprenticed to a woodcarver in his teens. By 1827 though, he had entered the entertainment field and was acting in theaters around the United States.
Career.
About 1828, Rice developed a burnt-cork blackface character called Jim Crow. This character was a witty, raggedy black man, and was based on a real-life black stableman Rice saw singing and dancing to a tune called "Jump Jim Crow". By 1830, Rice was performing in theaters as Jim Crow. His act was widely popular in America and England. 
In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, "Jim Crow" became a term used to describe racial segregation laws in the United States. Whites referred to all black males as "Jim Crows". Rice wrote and appeared in "Ginger Blue, Jim Crow in London", and a comic rendition of "Othello". He also appeared on Broadway as the title character in an adaptation of "Uncle Tom's Cabin".
Death.
About 1840, Rice began to suffer from a paralysis that affected his speech and movement. He died of a stroke on September 19, 1860, and was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

History of the geologic time scale

This article describes the history of the geologic time scale.
The principles were first laid down by Nicolaus Steno in the late 17th century. Steno argued that rock layers (or strata) are laid down in succession, and that each represents a "slice" of time. 
Steno formulated the principle of superposition. This says that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it. This principle is simple, but applying it to real rocks is complicated by their history. During the 18th century geologists realized that: 
The first serious attempts to formulate a geological time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth took place in the late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts was led by Abraham Werner and others. They divided the rocks of the Earth's crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a period of Earth history. It was possible to speak of a "Tertiary period" as well as of "Tertiary rocks". Indeed, "Tertiary" (now Palaeocene-Pliocene) and "Quaternary" (now Pleistocene-Holocene) remained in use as names of geological periods well into the 21th century.
Werner had the idea that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood. That is called the Neptunist theory. A major shift in thinking came when James Hutton read his "Theory of the Earth; or, an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe" before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March and April 1785. James Hutton in those reading became "the founder of modern geology". Hutton suggested the interior of the Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock. Land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory was called Plutonist in contrast to the flood-oriented theory.
The identification of strata by the fossils they contained was pioneered by William Smith, Georges Cuvier and others in the early 19th century. Geologists could divide Earth history more precisely. If two strata (however distant in space or different in composition) contained the same fossils, chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time. Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geological periods still used today. Cuvier thought many of the geological features of the Earth could be explained by catastrophic events which had caused the extinction of many species of animals. Over the course of his career, Cuvier came to believe there had not been a single catastrophe, but several, resulting in a succession of different faunas. 
British geologists were most active in the 19th century. The "Cambrian," (the Roman name for Wales) and the "Ordovician," and "Silurian", named after ancient Welsh tribes, were periods defined by Welsh rocks. The "Devonian" was named after the English county of Devon, and the name "Carboniferous" was simply an adaptation of "the Coal Measures," the old British geologists' term for the same set of strata. The "Permian" was named after Perm, Russia, because it was defined using strata in that region by a Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison. British geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into eras and the subdivision of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods into epochs. In general, periods were named after places where the rocks were easy to see.
Geologists and paleontologists based the geologic table on the relative positions of different strata and fossils. They estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various processes. They estimated weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and how long it took to turn sediment into hard rock. The discovery of radioactivity in 1896 and its geological applications by radiometric dating happened in the first half of the 20th century. It made possible the absolute dating of rocks, and the discovery of the age of the Earth. 
The International Commission on Stratigraphy is working to define exactly when geologic periods start and finish, and where the best examples are. They are called Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSP).

Yam

A yam is a root vegetable. It is similar to a sweet potato. It comes from China. The inside of a yam is white. Yams are related to lilies and grasses.
Yam is the common name for some species in the genus "Dioscorea". These are perennial vines grown to eat. They are grown in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Oceania. 95 percent of world's yam crop is harvested in West Africa.
Yam is a vegetable that can be cooked in may ways. It can be barbecued; roasted; fried; grilled; boiled; baked; smoked and when grated it is used in desserts.
Yam tubers can grow up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in length and weigh up to 70 kilograms (154 lb) and 3 to 6 inches high. The skin is rough and hard to peel. It softens after heating. The inside ranges in color from white or yellow to purple or pink in mature yams.
Some people in the United States and Canada call the sweet potato a yam, but it is not a yam.

Give You What You Like

"Give You What You Like" is a soft rock ballad from Avril Lavigne. The lyrics are about fighting loneliness by having sex. The song has gotten praise from critics for expanding Lavigne's musical diversity. "Give You What You Like" is the fifth single from Lavigne's self-titled album, "Avril Lavigne".
Critical reception.
Critics liked "Give You What You Like". They complimented the mature sound that Lavigne showed on the song. They also liked its equally mature themes. Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" wrote that "the bright-eyed innocence of '17' and 'Bitchin' Summer' has vanished on 'Give You What You Like'". He further called it "a harrowing glimpse inside the exchange of physical pleasures to combat loneliness". But he criticized the song's production. He ended his review by comparing Lavigne's vocals in the song to those of her 2002 hit, "I'm with You". 
Allan Raible of ABC News wrote, "As the tempos slow down, things get less juvenile and slightly more interesting. 'Give You What You Like' begins with the words, 'Please wrap your drunken arms around me.' (At last, darker material!) This is a rather sleazy song, but it is way more interesting than the shallow stabs at teen pop. At least there is some sort of grit. It's not just a middle finger (referencing the album's opening track, "Rock n Roll")."

Yi qi

Yi is a genus of climbing and gliding dinosaurs from the Jurassic of China. Its only species, Yi qi is known from a single fossil specimen of an adult found in middle or late Jurassicof Hebei, China. It lived about 160 million years ago. 
"Yi" was a small, possibly tree-dwelling (arboreal) animal. Like other of its family, "Yi" had an unusual, elongated third finger. This helped to support a membranous gliding plane (aerofoil) made of skin. 
The gliding planes of "Yi qi" were also supported by a long, bony strut attached to the wrist. This modified wrist bone and gliding membrane is unique among all known dinosaurs, and might have resulted in wings similar in appearance to those of bats.

Koyashskoye or Koyashs'ke is a salt lake on the coast of the Kerch Peninsula in Crimea. It is separated from the Black Sea by a strip of land. It is 4 by and 1 m deep. The water color varies from pink to the scarlet, depending on the light, because there are microscopic algae living in the water. When the water evaporates, it leaves a deposit of salt on the stones and the shores. The salt becomes crystal, producing crystal stones and the scent of viola.
This lake is considered healing and is appreciated by some local people. It is not widely known to tourists.

Catnip

Nepeta cataria, catnip or catmint, is a species of the genus "Nepeta". It is in the Lamiaceae family. The name "catmint" is sometimes used for the genus as a whole.
Cat behaviour.
Catnip, and some other species in the genus "Nepeta", is known for its effects on cat behaviour. Cats rub on the plant, roll on the ground, paw at it, lick it, and chew it. Some leap about and purr, some cry out. Cats do it for about five to fifteen minutes, after which olfactory fatigue usually sets in.:p.107 
The nepetalactone in catnip acts as a feline attractant after it enters the cat's nose. At the olfactory epithelium, the nepetalactone binds to one or more olfactory receptors.
The catnip effect works on the whole cat family, not just on domestic cats.. Several tests showed that leopards, cougars, servals, and lynxes often reacted strongly to catnip in a manner similar to domestic cats. Lions and tigers may react strongly as well, but they don't react all the time.
With domestic cats, "N. cataria" is a recreational substance for pets to enjoy. Catnip and catnip-laced products are available to consumers. 
Not all cats are affected by catnip; roughly one third are not affected by the plant. The behavior is hereditary.
Some other plants also have a similar effect on cats, include valerian ("Valeriana officinalis").

Leshy

Leshy (Polish: "Leszy" 
 
, in English sometimes spelled Leshii or Leszi) is a mythical creature that appears in Slavic mythology. It is also the subject in “The Witcher” Saga written by Andrzej Sapkowski.
A Leshy is male and human in shape and can assume any form. A Leshy can change in size and height. In some accounts, the leshy is described as having a wife ("leshachikha/leszachka/lesovikha") and children ("leshonki/leszonky"). Because he is known to lead travelers astray and abduct children, which he shares with Chort, or "The Black One," the Leshy is believed by some to be evil. Others view him as more of a temperamental being like a fairy.
In mythology.
In beliefs of Slavic people, Leshy appears in forests. He’s kind of a protector of the forest and everything that lives in it. His natural form looks like a human but he can easily shapeshift into any plant or animal. A Leshy has long hair and beard made of grass.
"The Witcher" books and games.
In Sapkowski's "The Witcher" (Polish: Wiedźmin), a leshy is a monster that lives in the forest. It has been described as something that "lives only to kill". When they kill something or a human, they do not leave much for the carrion eaters
In the "Witcher" video game, a Leshy is a highly intelligent monster that lives in forest. Common people thinks that he is like friendly sentinel of the forest. That is not true. This is a very dangerous creature that hunts down whatever lives and moves. It can polymorph. In its primary form the creature looks like a bear and wildcat combined. It has long fangs and sharp claws. When it hunts it lurks among the tree branches and then jumps on its victims. Usually it eats the whole victim. It can morph into human shape or can look like a tree branch.

Jineth Bedoya Lima

This name uses Spanish naming customs; the first or paternal family name is "Bedoya" and the second or maternal family name is "Lima".
Jineth Bedoya Lima (born c. 1974) is a Colombian journalist. She wrote about the illegal gun trade. She was kidnapped in May 2000 and August 2003. In 2001, she received the Courage In Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation. In 2012, she received the International Women of Courage Award from the U. S. Department of State.
Work.
2000 kidnapping.
In 2000, Bedoya was kidnapped. She worked at the newspaper "El Espectador" in Bogota, Colombia. Her job was to write about the Colombian war against terrorism. On 25 May, she went to La Modelo prison in Bogota. She planned to talk to a leader called "the Baker". She was afraid of a trap, so she went with an editor and photographer from "El Espectador" newspaper. While she waited to go into the prison, they were separated, and Bedoya disappeared. 
Three men kidnapped Bedoya. They said their boss was paramilitary leader Carlos Castaño. In May 2011, the police arrested a paramilitary soldier. He said he was one of Bedoya's three attackers.
2003 kidnapping.
In 2001, Bedoya started a job with "El Tiempo" newspaper in Colombia. Her job was to write about crime, including paramilitary groups. In early August 2003, she went to the town of Puerto Alvira. She wanted to write about how the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) controlled the town and forced the 1,100 people in the town to work in the illegal cocaine trade. The leader of the FARC guerrillas kidnapped Bedoya and her photographer. 
The FARC leader ordered the people in the town not to help the journalists, but the women of the town brought food to them. Then the people in the town told the regional FARC commander, and the journalists were free. When Bedoya returned, she wrote a story about the town in FARC-controlled land, but she was careful and did not write about the townspeople who helped her.
Book.
In 2010, Bedoya wrote a book called "Vida y muerte del Mono Jojoy" about Víctor Julio Suárez Rojas, or "Mono Jojoy", a FARC leader who was killed. Because of the book, the Colombian organization Foundation for Press Freedom and the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression were afraid for Bedoya's safety. Bedoya continued to work as a journalist for "El Tiempo", but the Colombian government gave her three bodyguards and a bulletproof car.
Awards.
In 2000, Bedoya received the CJFE International Press Freedom Award from the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression. 
In 2001, Bedoya received the Courage In Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation. The award was very important in Colombia, and Bedoya became well known. Because of this, Bedoya left "El Espectador" newspaper and went to work for "El Tiempo" newspaper. 
In 2012, Bedoya received the International Women of Courage Award from the U. S. Department of State.

Jeb Bush presidential campaign, 2016

The 2016 presidential campaign of John Ellis "Jeb" Bush, the 43rd Governor of Florida, was formally launched on June 15, 2015, coming six months after announcing the formal exploration of a candidacy for the 2016 Republican nomination for the President of the United States on December 16, 2014, and the formation of his Right to Rise PAC. It is headquartered in Miami, Florida.
Background.
There has been speculation that Bush would make a run for President since the end of the 2012 election. Speculation was fueled when Bush announced he would be "actively exploring" a run for President on December 16, 2014 and resigned from several corporate boards. It has been further speculated that Bush has put off formally announcing a candidacy in order to raise unlimited amounts of money for his Right to Rise Super PAC, and prepare strategy; once formally a candidate, Bush cannot coordinate with PACs or Super PACs under campaign finance law.
Announcement and preliminary campaign.
On June 4, the same day of Governor Rick Perry's formal campaign announcement, an anonymous Bush staffer leaked that Bush would formally announce his candidacy on June 15. Bush made a trip to Germany, Poland, and Estonia before returning to begin his campaign. On June 15, 2015, Bush formally announced his candidacy at Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus, in Miami, Florida.
Bush embarked on a tour following his June 15 announcement, with stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. The Bush campaign cancelled events in Charleston, South Carolina in light of the June 17 mass shooting.
Fundraising.
On July 9, 2015, at a campaign fund-raising conference in the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush announced that super PACs which support his candidacy, mainly Right to Rise, had received a total of $103 million during the previous six months. The campaign itself had received $11.4 million, $700,000 a day, during its first two weeks.

Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016

 
The 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, the junior United States Senator from Vermont, and former Congressman of the same, began with a formal announcement by Sanders on May 26, 2015 in Burlington, Vermont, which followed an informal announcement on April 30. 
Sanders had been considered a potential candidate for President of the United States, both as an Independent and a Democrat since at least November 2013. Although Sanders became an independent after briefly aligning with the left-wing Liberty Union Party in the 1970s, many of his views align with those of the Democratic Party, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, and he has confirmed that he is running as a Democrat.
Background.
Sanders' political successes have been in rural Vermont. Sanders has been involved in political activism nearly his entire adult life. While in college he protested against police brutality, led a weeks long sit-in against housing segregation, and worked as an organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality. 
In 1963 he traveled to Washington to attend the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
Sanders has supported full equality for gay Americans since at least 1972. As Mayor of Burlington, Bernie Sanders played a prominent role in building support in Vermont for Jesse Jackson's campaign for the presidency in 1984 and 1988.
Campaign.
Sanders states that his campaign will focus on what he considers to be "real family values". Saying, "The right has claimed the mantle of 'family values' for far too long. When my Republican colleagues use the term they’re usually talking about things like opposition to contraception, denying a woman’s right to choose, opposition to gay rights, and support for abstinence-only education," Sanders advocates what he calls "real family values" which include paid sick time, paid vacations, and access to paid family leave. Speaking on woman's pro-choice issues, he commented that "[Republicans believe] that [a woman] cannot control her own body. I disagree. Let's say it loud and clear: Women control their own bodies – not the government."
Sanders has used social media to help his campaign gain momentum. Along with posting content on Twitter and Facebook, he held an "Ask Me Anything" on Reddit on May 19, 2015.
On September 30, the Sanders campaign announced that it had reached 1 million individual donations, becoming the first in 2015 to reach that threshold.
Fundraising.
Sanders raised over $1.5 million in the first 24 hours after he announced his presidential campaign on April 30, 2015. This was greater than the amount raised by any of the Republican candidates in the first 24 hours after their respective announcements. By May 5, Sanders campaign had received approximately 75,000 contributions and had raised $3 million, with the average donation being $43. According to a campaign adviser, 99.4 percent of the donations were $250 or less, and 185,000 supporters had signed up on the campaign's website.
Affect.
When Sanders opened his campaign in June, his rallies were compared with those of Hillary Clinton. Sanders's campaign events have been drawing "overflow crowds" around the country. Sanders drew more than 700 supporters at a mid-June event in Iowa, which the "Wall Street Journal" noted as
“the same number who went to a Hillary Clinton event on Sunday that featured a buffet table and a live band.” A crowd of an estimated 3,000 attended an event in Minneapolis. Sanders said he was "Stunned. Stunned. I mean I had to fight my way to get into the room. Standing room only. Minneapolis was literally beyond belief."
On August 8, Sanders drew a crowd of over 12,000 in Seattle, Washington. The rally took place in the basketball arena of the University of Washington, which was filled to capacity. Before the rally, Sanders spoke to an additional 3,000 supporters outside who could not get into the arena. Black Lives Matter activists had interrupted an earlier event and prevented Sanders from taking the podium. The rally in Seattle was part of a three-day West Coast tour. 
On the following day, August 9, Sanders spoke to a record crowd of 20,000 supporters inside the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon. The event was again filled to capacity, with 8,000 supporters waiting in the overflow area provided by venue officials. The West Coast tour ended on August 10, with a large rally in Los Angeles, California. The event was filled to capacity, with Sanders' campaign claiming over 27,000 people turned out, breaking the record he set the day before. The rally included an introduction from comedian Sarah Silverman.
As of August 15, 2015, Sanders had partially consolidated Democratic opposition to Clinton's nomination but had not significantly affected the level of support for her. A mid-September CBS poll that included Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a presidential bid, showed Sanders leading Clinton 52 percent to Clinton's 30 percent in New Hampshire and 43 percent to Clinton's 33 percent in Iowa.

Maria Bashir

Maria Bashir is a lawyer in Afghanistan. She is the only women to have the job of prosecutor in the country. She has 15 years experience in the Afghan government. During the time of the Taliban, she was not permitted to work. Instead, she had an illegal school for girls in her house. In 2006, after the time of the Taliban, she worked as Chief Prosecutor General of Herat Province. In 2010, she had 87 cases; mostly about corruption and oppression of women.
In 2011, she received the International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State. 
Life.
Bashir was the oldest child in her family. She was a very good student. Her father encouraged her to study. When she graduated, she had to choose three subjects for graduate school. Her three choices were law, law, and law. The Minister for Higher Education approved her to study law. She got a law degree from Kabul University. Later she studied in Kabul for one year to be a prosecutor.
In 1996, after she graduated, Bashir got married. She moved to Herat, her husband's city. Her husband has an import business in China. Bashir has two sons and a daughter. The oldest son studies in Germany. The other two children study at home, because of death threats against Bashir and her family.
Work.
After Bashir finished school, she went to work at the Attorney General's office. She worked as a criminal investigator in Kabul, and later in Herat.
After Bashir moved to Herat, in 1995, the Taliban came. They stopped women from working. Bashir stayed in the house, like the other women. The Taliban made it illegal for girls to read or work. This ensured that women and girls remained dependent on men. Bashir started an underground school in her house. The students hid their books inside shopping bags.
In 2001, the American invasion allowed women to start work again. Bashir went back to her old job as a criminal investigator. When the Attorney General visited Herat in 2006, he met with prosecutors from four provinces. Bashir was the only woman at the meeting. The Attorney General said he was happy with Bashir's murder case against the husband of Afghan poet and journalist Nadia Anjuman. The Attorney General made Bashir the Chief Prosecutor General of the province.
The new Afghan constitution.
The U.S. government welcomed Bashir as a sign of Westernization after the Taliban. The US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice flew Bashir to Washington for talks. However, Bashir said many negative things about the new constitution. The new constitution gave equal rights to women, but many judges still used the old Islamic Sharia Law. Bashir said the new law did not give women freedom to choose their husbands. She also said that men were not sent to trial for adultery, but women were stoned to death for the same thing. In divorce, the husband always got the children; women thought suicide was better. On the subject of corruption, Bashir wanted to stop appointments based on ethnic groups. She also wanted more money for officials. She said the corruption would not stop if the officials had to find more money somewhere.

Child labour in India

Child labour in India is when Indian children work for money, on a part or full-time basis. 
The practice deprives children of their childhood, and is harmful to their physical and mental development. Various things lead to children working. Poverty, lack of good schools and informal work places may be blamed.
The 1998 national census of India estimated the total number of child labour, aged 4-15, to be at 12.6 million, out of a total child population of 253 million in 5-14 age group. The 2011 national census of India found the total number of child labour, aged 5–14, to be at 4.35 million, and the total child population to be 259.64 million in that age group. 
The child labour problem is not unique to India; worldwide, about 217 million children work, many full-time.

The "'Kantō Plain (関東平野 "Kantō heiya") 
 
 is the largest plain in Japan. It is in the Kanto Region of central Honshū. The total area 17,000 km2 covers more than half of the region. It extends over Tokyo, Saitama Prefecture, Kanagawa Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, Gunma Prefecture, and Tochigi Prefecture.
A number of plateaus make up a large part of the plain. These large plateaus are divided into smaller ones by shallow river valleys. Volcanic ash from surrounding volcanoes are thought to have been deposited on these plateaus.
What is unusual is the overall tilt of the plateaus and hills. The entire area is slightly bent or slanted and forms a basin centered in the Tone River and Tokyo Bay. Tectonic changes are still happening, as the plain’s central region gradually sinks lower towards sea level.

Twine

Twine (also called baler twine) is a light string or strong thread made from two or more smaller strands or yarns twisted together. More generally, the term can be applied to a cord. It is often synonymous with string but is usually thicker. Natural fibres used for making twine include cotton, sisal, jute, hemp, henequen, and coir. A variety of synthetic fibres may also be used. Twine is available in colors, plain or waxed. Twine is as useful as duct tape in that it can be used for a wide variety of repairs.
Uses.
In arts and crafts, twine is used for a wide variety of projects. It is used in knitting, crocheting, and making jewellery, to mention just a few. Commercially, twine is used in upholstery, rug-making, agriculture, the cotton industry, textiles, and in the carton industry.
History.
Twine traces its history back to as early as 32,000 years ago. Wild flax fibers were used to make twine for clothing, baskets and creating tools. Hunter-gatherers processed flax into strong cords or twine. 
Archaeologists discovered flax fiber cords in a western Asian cave that date from from 32,000 to 26,000 years ago. In a cave at Lascaux, France fossilized remains of a “two-ply laid rope of about 7 mm diameter” were dated to about 15,000 BCE. Hemp twine was used from about 8,000 BCE. By 1,000 BCE hemp rope and twine was used by most civilizations. From 500 BCE to 1900 AD almost all rope and twine used in sailing ships was made from hemp. For example, the USS Constitution used hemp for its rigging lines. Sea bags and other common goods used help cordage or twine.
In the 1630s hemp was used to produce cordage in Boston. Soon there were several ropewalks in Boston producing hemp rope. Hemp twine was twisted into rope.

Pontiac Aztek

The Pontiac Aztek is a mid-size crossover sold by the Pontiac division of General Motors from 2001-2005. The vehicle was GM's first venture into the crossover market. It also had a twin the Buick Rendezvous. Both were built on the GM's minivan platform. The Aztek was a cross between a minivan and an SUV. 
With a front engine and four-wheel drive (available after January 2001), the Aztek featured a four-speed automatic transmission and a V-6 engine. Pontiac marketed it as a "sport recreational vehicle." It featuring 94 cubic feet of cargo room capable of carrying a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood with its rear seats removed. Other features included a rear center console that doubled as a removable cooler. It had rear stereo controls in the cargo area. The Aztek featured an available camping package with an attachable tent and inflatable mattress. The latter could be inflated by a built-in air compressor.
The Aztek was a commercial failure. It was also called one of the worst vehicles ever made. Criticized for its awkward styling it was called downright ugly. The Aztek was phased out and replaced by the Pontiac Torrent. The Rendezvous continued to be sold until 2008 when it was replaced by the Enclave.

Sax Rohmer was Arthur Henry Ward (15 February 1883 – 1 June 1959). He was an English novelist born in Birmingham to Irish parents. He is best remembered for his creation of the master criminal Dr Fu Manchu.
After ghostwriting the autobiography of Little Tich, a music hall entertainer, Ward issued the first Fu Manchu novel. This was "The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu", serialised from October 1912 to June 1913. 
It was an immediate success. It had police official Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie facing a worldwide conspiracy led by a mastermind. It reflected the "yellow peril" scares of the times. The phrase yellow peril (sometimes yellow terror or yellow spectre), was coined by Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, in the 1890s.
The Fu Manchu stories, and other writing, made Rohmer one of the most successful and well-paid authors of the 1920s and 1930s.

AC Cobra

The AC Cobra is a hybrid American sportscar consisting of a British roadster with an American engine and transmission. In 1961 Carroll Shelby took a dated AC Ace sports car and installed a Ford V-8 engine with a Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed transmission. The resulting car made history. Designed as a Corvette-killer it was one of the fastest cars available at the time. They were produced and sold by Carroll Shelby International Inc. 
History.
Carroll Shelby was one of the world's first professional race car drivers. At age 37 a bad heart forced his retirement from racing. He started building cars in the back of a tire dealership in Santa Fe Springs, California. He soon moved a few miles to Garden Springs. He wanted to build an American sportscar. Others had experimented with putting an American engine into a European car body. Shelby thought he could do it better. He approached General Motors with the idea but they already had the Corvette. They were also not interested in a limited production sports car. Ford, however, was very interested. Shelby also learned that AC Limited in England was having trouble getting motors for their cars. He told them Ford was interested in supplying engines if they would ship him a car to test. They sent a body and Ford sent him a V-8. He and a friend worked all night installing the engine. In the morning they had the first Shelby AC Cobra.
In the beginning Shelby used Ford's 260 cu in. engine. The V8 worked so well within the spacious engine bay Shelby looked for a larger engine. In 1963 the 289 was installed and worked very well. In 1964 Shelby moved to Ford's 427 cu in. engine and made the chassis stronger in 1965.
Racing.
In October 1962 a Cobra was winning at Riverside, California when a broken hub put it out of the race. In January 1963 a Cobra won at Riverside. Cobras raced at Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans. 
In 1964 a specially designed 427 coupe won the GT Championship. The same year raced at Le Mans and placed fourth. Their legend continued to grow on the racetrack.
Production.
From 1961 to 1968 a total of only 998 were built. Of these 655 were 289 Cobras and 343 were 427 Cobras. In late 1968 AC stopped production of the Ace body. They continued to produce AC Cobras for Shelby until 1968.
Shelby didn't make any more Cobras until the early 1990s. He watched as prices soared for his original cars. He also saw many Cobra replicas being built; some good, some not so good. He still had a number of unused chassis numbers for cars designed to be built in 1965. He wanted to sell them as new 1965 models but the state of California would only allow them to be sold for off-road use. He built only nine "Completion Cobras". Shelby then began to build cars as "rollers" that could be completed by an authorized dealer. They were available with a fiberglass body or the original aluminum body. He offered 289 Cobras and Cobras with 427 "side-oiler" engines. Shelby offered a 50th anniversary Cobra in all black with red interiors. They had special gold badging. He made 50, available as rollers, which were all sold out in 48 hours.

Azerbaijan Carpet Museum

Azerbaijan Carpet Museum (formerly called the State Museum of Azerbaijan Carpet and Applied Art, displays Azerbaijani carpets and rugs. The display shows various weaving techniques and materials from various periods. It is named after Latif Karimov and has the largest collection of Azerbaijani carpets in the world.
It moved to a brand new building on the Baku's seafront park during 2014 from its former location on Neftchiler Avenue.
History.
The museum was established in 1967 and was first located in the Juma Mosque in the Old City. The mosque was built in the 15th century and then renovated in the 19th century. Its first exhibition was held in 1972. In 1992, after the collapse of USSR, the museum was moved to the second floor of what is now the Baku Museum Center, a building that had originally been the Lenin museum. The collection was named in honour of the carpet designer Latif Karimov.
Plans to move the collection to a new building have been in preparation since 2010 when Azerbaijani carpets were proclaimed "a Masterpiece of Intangible Heritage" by UNESCO.
The new building was due to open in late 2012 and was visited by President Ilham Aliyev in September 2013, but as of March 2014 the new building had not yet officially opened its doors to the public. In April 2014 the museum was renamed Azerbaijan Carpet Museum dropping its much longer official title.
Collection.
The collection of the museum includes over 10,000 items of ceramics, metal works of the 14th century, jewellery from the Bronze Age, carpets and carpet items from the 17th-20th centuries, national garments and embroidery, and applied art works (decorative arts and design) of the Modern Age. 
The museum organizes public lectures, study courses on carpets and applied arts.
It has a book store selling books on Azerbaijani crafts and carpet art.
The museum also holds a permanent collection from the Shusha Museum of History, from the city of Shusha, looted after occupation by Armenian troops in 1992. Part of the exhibited items of the Shusha museum were saved when the director of the museum moved out 600 carpets before the occupation. They are now displayed at the museum in an exhibition titled "Burned Culture".
International exhibitions.
The museum does research and public servie work. Every year, state and international exhibitions are organized and catalogues on carpets are printed by the museum. The museum has also held exhibitions in more than 30 countries including France, Germany, England, Japan, the Netherlands. In 1998, the museum participated in a UNESCO-organized exhibition in Paris dedicated to Fuzûlî and in 1999 dedicated to the 1,300th anniversary of the "Book of Dede Korkut" and displayed carpets, folk applied art items, including copper jugs, mugs, buckets and saddle-bags.

Nirbhaya &quot;Fearless&quot;

“Nirbhaya” (In Hindi, it means "the fearless one") whose real name was Jyoti Singh, was a 23-year-old physiotherapy student. On December 16, 2012, she was raped on a bus in Delhi, India. Because rape laws in India do not permit using a victim's name she was known only as "Nirbhaya". It is one of the many names the Indian media had given her. In 2013, “Nirbhaya” received the International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State, posthumously. 
Life.
“Nirbhaya” was born into a working class family. Her dream was to be a doctor. Her family spent their life savings so “Nirbhaya” could study medicine. She had just graduated from a physiotherapy program.
The attack.
On December 16, 2012, “Nirbhaya” was attacked on a bus. On the bus she and her male friend were beaten by five men. She was dragged to the back of the bus and repeatedly gang raped for over an hour. The bus driver drove all over Delhi while this was happening. She and her friend were left for dead at the side of the road. Police found them but no ambulance would come. Police took her to the hospital. She was taken into surgery.
The government of India, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, decided to move her to a Singapore hospital. Nirbhaya was in critical condition and on a ventilator. Doctors said there was no medical reason to move her. She was airlifted to Mt. Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.
Two weeks after the attack, on December 29, 2012, she died. Before she died, she made two police statements in the hospital. She said she wanted justice against the six attackers.
Aftermath.
“Nirbhaya”'s case started demonstrations and protests in India. It also started changes in the laws about violence against women. The five men and the bus driver were identified and arrested. They were charged with kidnapping, rape and murder. 
One of the men arrested committed suicide in prison. One, who was a teenager at the time, was given three years in a reformatory. That was the maximum allowed for a juvenile in India. The remaining four were given the death penalty. It was Nirbhaya's dying wish the men be “burned alive”. Her parents, who had been demanding they hang, said they were satisfied by the sentences.
Two years after the attack India is still the fourth worst country in the world for women. In 2013, a year after her rape, there was a large increase in the number of persons arrested for rape. But the number of rapes had also risen sharply.

Feature phone

A feature phone is a type of mobile phone. The name "feature phone" usually means the phone cannot do things that a smartphone can do. Feature phones basically allow people to make phone calls and sent text messages, while a few may also be able to play multimedia and access the internet and other services offered by the user's wireless service provider.
Modern feature phones can have smartphone-like 3G connectivity, touchscreens, and access to popular social networking services. However, these phones do not support software made by other companies as much as smartphones—because of this, feature phones are also called dumb phones.
People often buy feature phones as they are cheaper than smartphones, especially in emerging markets. In the past few years, however, phone makers have begun to make and sell cheap smartphones for sale in places where high-end smartphones are not popular.
As a result, as of 2015, feature phones are now considered very low quality products.

<doc id="507123" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507123" title="Production vehicle">
Production vehicle

The features of a production vehicle or production car are mass-produced identical models, offered for sale to the public. They must also be able to be legally driven on public roads ("street legal"). Legislation and other rules further define the production vehicle within particular countries or uses. There is no single worldwide definition of the term.
Origin.
The term "production car" had come into use by about 1917 in the United States. The phrase was a shortened form of "mass-produced car". The phrase also meant the car was made in production, as opposed to a prototype.
At that time production cars meant cheaper vehicles such as Ford's Model T. These were made in relatively large numbers on production lines. The more expensive cars were coach built models (see "Limited production" below). Now the term has broadened to include vehicles that are hand assembled or assembled on an assembly line. The main criteria is there are a number of the same model with the same specifications.
There is no fixed definition of the number of vehicles or the amount of modification allowed outside of motorsports. There are no national regulations or laws that determine what is or is not a production vehicle. By 2011, the "Guinness Book of Records" listed the Bugatti Veyron as the world's fastest production car. But only five of this version were made. In 2013 their decision was appealed on the ground that the Bugatti was a modified versionGuinness upheld the appeal and initiated a review of their production car definition. The outcome of the review was that the Bugatti record was reinstated. Guinness were also reported in some sources as saying that at least 50 identical vehicles were needed to be made to constitute a production car. In February 2014, "Road and Track" wrote that Guinness required 30 identical vehicles.
Definitions.
Motorsports.
There have been many disputes over what makes production and modified cars when used in motorsports. Even under Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the exact definition of what was (or was not) a production car was unclear. This led to rules written in 1955. The term is defined for particular types of vehicles. It also means that a certain number of a model must be produced in order to qualify as "production". But it is another matter to enforce the rules. For example, the 1968 FIA rules state that "production" for sports cars need to have at least 25 identical cars produced within a 12-month period. They also were meant for normal sale to individual purchasers. However, FIA rules tend to allow a degree of modification from the original.
Land Speed Records.
The FIA Land Speed Records Commission has regulations for series-production cars attempting land speed records under its "2014 Appendix D - Regulations for Land Speed Record Attempts". Series-production cars fall under rule D2.3.2. It says that they must be: Category B: Series-production Automobiles in production at the time of the application for the Record Attempt and either homologated by the FIA, or for which an application for homologation has been made to the FIA or recognised by the ASN of the country in which they are manufactured for National Records.
Legislation.
Several countries have laws that define production vehicles. For example, in the United States Briggs Cunningham's business was classified as a hobby by tax officials. This was because he did not manufacture enough of each model for the Cunningham automobile to be considered a production vehicle. The IRS classified them as high-performance prototype automobiles built as racecars. Legislative definitions tend to revolve around issues of safety or revenue (taxation).
Modified cars.
Some car tuning specialists such as Alpina who modify BMW's, are recognized as vehicle manufacturers by some governments. This brings them within the definition of a production vehicle in their country. Not all performance specialists are officially recognised. As a result their cars are not usually referred to as production vehicles.
Limited production cars.
These are usually vehicles where the production run is restricted to a specific number of vehicles. An example of this is the 1957 Rambler Rebel, a limited-production car where only 1,500 were produced.

GM Lambda platform

GM Lambda platform is a car platform designed and used by General Motors. It is a full-size crossover platform. Lambda is based on the earlier GM Epsilon platform. The Lambda platform replaces GM's U minivan platform and the GMT360 SUV platform. This is used for the Chevrolet Malibu sedan and other similar models. The Lambda architecture is used by the Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia.
The Buick Enclave concept car was previewed at the 2006 North American International Auto Show. The Saturn Outlook was shown at the 2006 New York Auto Show. The 2007 Outlook and GMC Acadia went into production in late 2006. This was followed by the 2008 Enclave in mid-2007, and the 2009 Chevrolet Traverse in mid-2008.
Lambda vehicles feature easily accessible three-row seating. They were supplied with the LY7 3.6-liter V6. Starting with the 2009 model year all Lambda vehicles have GM LLT 3.6-liter gasoline direct injection engine for improved fuel efficiency, horsepower and torque. It is unlikely GM will offer a V8 engine for Lambda. The platform has been designed for front and all-wheel drive applications. Lambda is expected to be replaced by the new GM C1XX platform.
The lambda-based GM vehicles are now considered America's most American vehicle. Frank DuBois, of the Washington, DC-based American University created a new model for finding out which cars have the highest percentage of American-made parts and labor. His index shows the GM Lambda platform CUVs are the most "American made."

Country rock

Country rock is a subgenre of country music. It was formed by the wave of rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes. They used vocal styles and additional instrumentation, in particular pedal steel guitar. Country rock began with Bob Dylan. It reached its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists like Emmylou Harris, the Eagles and the Doobie Brothers. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres. This included The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock.

Division of Northern Territory

The Division of Northern Territory was an Australian Electoral Division in the Northern Territory from 1922 until 2001. During this time it was the only Division in the Territory.
The Division was set up in 1922, as a part of the "Northern Territory Representation Act 1922". The Member for Northern Territory did not have full voting rights until 1968, and did not count for the purpose of forming government. Before 1936, the Member could speak in the House and take part in committee work, but could not vote. Between 1936 and 1959 the Member had limited voting on Territory laws. Between 1959 and 1968, the Member could only vote on laws that affected the Territory.
In December 2000, the Division was split into two new divisions, the Division of Solomon, which covered the area immediately around Darwin, and the Division of Lingiari, which covered the rest of the territory. 
On 19 February 2003, the new Divisions were removed and a single Division was brought back. In 28 April 2004 the "Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Act 2004" had the effect of leaving the Northern Territory divided into two Divisions.

Banu Sulaym

The Banu Sulaym (Arabic: بنو سليم 
 
) was a group of Nomadic Arabs. In the 11th century they migrated from Upper Egypt into what is now Tunisia and eastern Algeria. They defeated the Berbers. 
History.
Oral tradition says that the tribe would have left Arabia to go to Egypt. According to their legend they rebelled against the Caliph of Baghdad in the second half of the 10th century. In 1049, when the Zirid ruler of Tunisia rebelled against Egypt, nomads were sent to punish them. Ibn Khaldun, an early Tunisian historian, said they were like "a cloud of locusts" when they invaded Tunisia. The Arab poets told of their many conquests as they moved west. They were defeated in a series of battles during the 12th century by the Moroccan dynasty. Even though it was an oral history, they were a real tribe. They did come from the Arabian Peninsula. They did control much of North Africa for over a century. They were mostly installed in the south of Tunisia and Libya as well as a minority in the south of Algeria and the Moroccan plains.

The Maqil (Arabic: المعقل 
 
) were an Arabian nomadic tribe. In the 11th century they migrated from Yemen into what is now the Sahara Desert and Morocco. They mainly settled near forests and oases.
Despite their originally small number (less than 200), they were later involved in fighting a dynasty of Sunni Muslims. They also brought change to the culture of these regions, and a new language.
Genealogy.
They descend from son of , father of the Hebrews and coming from the line of Seth, son of Adam.
History.
The exact origin of the Maqil tribe is unknown. They claimed for themselves a prestigious Banu Hashim descent from Jaafar ibn Abi Talib, son of Abu Talib and brother of Ali ibn Abi Talib. Arabian genealogists categorized them as Hilalians. Ibn Khaldun wrote that both of these versions are false, since the Banu Hashim lived in urban cities and weren't nomadic nor ever wandered in desert wolds. He added that the Maqil is a name only found in Yemen.
Ibn Khaldun speculated that they were likely an Arab nomadic group from Yemen, and this is supported by bn al-Kalbi and Ibn Said.

Stanley never knew his father, and was abandoned by his mother after birth. His birth certificate describes him as a bastard. The stigma of illegitimacy weighed heavily upon him all his life.
Finding Livingstone.
In 1869, Stanley was instructed by the "New York Herald" to find the Scottish missionary and explorer David Livingstone, who was known to be in Africa but had not been heard from for some time. According to Stanley's account, he asked how much he could spend. The reply was "Draw £1,000 now, and when you have gone through that, draw another £1,000, and when that is spent, draw another £1,000, and when you have finished that, draw another £1,000, and so on — BUT FIND LIVINGSTONE!" Stanley had lobbied his employer for several years to mount this expedition.
Stanley found Livingstone on 10 November 1871, in Ujiji near Lake Tanganyika in present-day Tanzania. He may have greeted him with the now-famous line, "" It may also have been a fabrication, as Stanley tore out of his diary the pages relating to the encounter.
Researching the Congo River.
In 1874, the "New York Herald," in partnership with Britain's "Daily Telegraph," financed Stanley on another expedition to the African continent. One of his missions was to solve a last great mystery of Africa by tracing the course of the Congo River to the sea. The difficulty of this expedition is hard to overstate. Stanley used sectional boats to pass the great cataracts that separated the Congo into distinct tracts. The boats had to be taken apart and transported around the rapids before being rebuilt to travel on the next section of river. After 999 days, on 9 August 1877, Stanley reached the Portuguese outpost of Boma, around 100 km from the mouth of the Congo River. Starting with 356 people, he reached Boma with 114 survivors, and he was the only European left. He wrote about his trials in his book "Through the Dark Continent".
Claiming the Congo for the Belgian king.
Stanley was approached by King Leopold II of the Belgians, the ambitious Belgian monarch. In 1876 the king organized a private holding company disguised as an international scientific and philanthropic (goodwill) association. He called it the "International African Association". 
The King spoke of his intentions to introduce Western civilization and bring religion to that part of Africa. He did not mention he wanted to claim the lands. At the end of his life, the King was embittered that his establishment of a Congo Free State was spoilt by its unscrupulous government. Also, the spread of sleeping sickness across central Africa may have been caused by the movements of Stanley's enormous baggage train, and the Emin Pasha relief expedition.
Emin Pasha Relief Expedition.
In 1886, Stanley led the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition to "rescue" Emin Pasha, the governor of Equatoria in the southern Sudan. King Leopold II demanded that Stanley take the longer route, via the Congo River. He hoped to get more territory. After immense hardships and great loss of life, Stanley met Emin in 1888, charted the Ruwenzori Range and Lake Edward, and emerged from the interior with Emin and his surviving followers at the end of 1890. 
This expedition tarnished Stanley's name because of the conduct of the other Europeans: British gentlemen and army officers. An army major was shot by a carrier, after he behaved with extreme cruelty. James Sligo Jameson, heir to Jameson's, an Irish whiskey manufacturer, bought an 11-year-old girl and offered her to cannibals to document and sketch how she was cooked and eaten. Stanley found out only when Jameson had died of fever.

Azerbaijani carpet

Azerbaijani carpets (Azerbaijani: "Azərbaycan xalçaları" 
 
) are carpets made in Azerbaijan, an ancient center of carpet weaving. The Azerbaijani carpet is a traditional handmade textile of many sizes, with dense texture and a smooth or rough surface, whose patterns are characteristic of Azerbaijan's many carpet-making regions. Traditionally, since ancient times the carpets were used in Azerbaijan to cover floors, decorate interior walls, sofas, chairs, beds and tables. 
Carpet making is a family tradition transferred orally and through practice, with carpet making and rug making being almost women's job. In the past every young girl had to learn the art of weaving carpets, and the carpets she wove became a part of her dowry. In the case of a newly married son, it was his mother who wove a large rug for his new household. Starting a new carpet meant a feast, but the completion of a rug meant an even greater celebration for the family. In the old days finished carpets were laid out in front of the house so that passers-by with the weight of their feet could make them even tighter than they had already been knotted. For the traditional process of carpet and rug making, men removed the wool from the sheep in the spring and autumn, while women collected dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. Azerbaijani carpets are divided into four large regional groups: Quba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh, and Baku. 
In November 2010 the Azerbaijani carpet was made a "Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage" by UNESCO.

Pokémon Colosseum

Pokémon Colosseum (ポケモンコロシアム, Pokemon Koroshiamu) 
 
 is a 2003 role-playing video game published by The Pokémon Company and developed by Genius Sonority. It was only released for the Nintendo GameCube. "Pokémon Colosseum" was released on November 21, 2003 in Japan, March 22, 2004 in North America, and on May 14, 2004 in Europe.
The concept for "Pokémon Colosseum" was influenced by RPGs like "Final Fantasy VII" and "". During an interview with Prima Games, "Pokémon" director Junichi Masuda was asked why the gameplay did not mirror that of the other games in the series. Masuda said "How players communicate with each other has been key to the "Pokémon" games – it is the backbone of all "Pokémon" game designs. I feel that the handheld systems work better than the home-based consoles. It's certainly possible to come up with concepts for home-based consoles, but we might then have to change the core of the game."
The game was first shown at E3 2003.
Reception.
IGN rated the game a 7.5 out of 10. Craig Harris of IGN said that the "Pokémon" RPG's move to 3D "does a decent enough job" and is "a bit more linear and straightforward".
In 2006, "Nintendo Power" ranked the game as the 121st greatest video game to appear on a Nintendo console.

Douglas Spalding

Douglas Alexander Spalding (1841–1877) was an English biologist. He was one of the founders of ethology (animal behaviour), but it took a long time before this was appreciated.
He was born in Islington in London in 1841, and began life as a workman. Later, when he lived near Aberdeen, he attended courses without charge. He studied philosophy and literature, but after a year he returned to London. Spalding trained to be a lawyer, but contracted tuberculosis. 
He travelled in Europe in hopes of finding a cure. In Avignon he met John Stuart Mill, and through Mill he met John Russell, Viscount Amberley. Russell was the son of the former British Prime Minister Lord John Russell. Spalding became tutor to Viscount Amberley's children, including perhaps the very young Bertrand Russell. He also carried on an intermittent affair with Katharine Russell, Lord Amberley's wife. After the Lord Amberley's death in 1876, Spalding returned to the continent and died there the following year.
Ethology.
Spalding carried out some remarkable experiments on animal behaviour, and discovered the phenomenon now known as imprinting. This was later rediscovered by Oskar Heinroth, then studied and popularised by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. 
Instinct and imprinting were the first scientific concepts in ethology. Spalding was able to prove that the behaviour of chicks after hatching from the egg happened even when they had no experience, practice or even information from the senses. Therefore the capacity was inherited. J.B.S. Haldane reprinted Spalding's essay "On Instinct" in 1954 to show how important it was for the history of ethology.
Spalding is credited by some as being the first to suggest genetic assimilation. He thought the evolution of instincts must
have its origin in learning. He argued that selection of those individuals which were the best learners would eventually
result in the appearance of the behaviour in the absence of learning.

Wild grape

Wild grapes are natural, uncultivated grapes. There are various species. Most are similar to each other, and difficult to tell apart. Fox grape ("vitis labrusca"), summer grape ("vitis aestivalis"), and riverbank grape ("vitis riparia") are some common species.
Wild grapes have woody vines which can climb over thirty feet tall. They have large, three-lobed leaves with teeth on the edges. They can be found on streambanks, pond edges, roadsides, and in open woods. In woods, the vine is probably very large and has grown up with the tree.
Wild grapes use tendrils (like above-ground roots) to grab onto branches or bark of larger plants. The bark is brownish-gray and very shreddy.
Wild grape flowers are green and small. They bloom from May to July. The fruit, of course, is what grapes are known for. They grow large berries in clusters of up to twenty. Fruits become ripe from August to October. The fruit is very important for wildlife. Each berry contains two to six seeds. When animals eat the fruit, they help spread the vines by defecating seeds in new places.
Many birds nest in wild grape tangles, and many use bark from the vine to build nests.

Oskar Heinroth

Oskar Heinroth (Mainz-Kastel, 1 March 1871 – Berlin, 31 May 1945) was a German biologist who was one of the founders of ethology. Heinroth was director of the Berlin Zoo & Aquarium for over 30 years. He married twice, both times to colleagues: He was married to Magdalena (née Wiebe, 1904-1932) and, after her death, to Katharina (née Berger, 1933-1945).
His studies of behaviour in the Anatidae (ducks and geese) showed their instinctive behaviour patterns. He also rediscovered the phenomenon of imprinting, reported in the 19th century by Douglas Spalding but not followed up at the time. Heinroth showed that the behaviour of birds was characteristic of a species, as much as its anatomy. 
His results were popularised by Konrad Lorenz, whose mentor he was. Lorenz regarded Heinroth as the true founder of the study of animal behaviour as a branch of zoology.

<doc id="507522" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507522" title="Mesozoic marine revolution">
Mesozoic marine revolution

The Mesozoic marine revolution was the great increase in sea-floor predators that ate shellfish. The term was used by Vermeij, a paleontologist who spent years investigating changes in seafloor invertebrates.
There was a notable change in sea-floor life between the Palaeozoic fauna and the modern fauna. This change occurred during the Mesozoic. In the Mesozoic era sea-floor predators evolved various new forms which fed on the abundant shellfish (brachiopods and bivalves). These predators are still abundant today: they are mostly the starfish, the gastropods, and the crabs.
Each predator has its own methods. Crabs break the shells by force. Various types of gastropods developed the ability to get into shells. The Muricidae bore through shells and consume prey. Some gastropods make holes in the shell and put in a paralysing or relaxing substance; others work on small cracks in the edge of the shell. Once they get their proboscis in, they eat the shellfish. Perhaps surprisingly, some sponges can also bore into shells. During the Mesozoic there were also a number of vertebrate predators of shellfish: the placodonts, and some ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs had flat shell-crushing teeth.
Starfish.
Starfish are the most common predators. The shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and hydraulic system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit. Then the starfish slips its stomach inside the shell. The stomach can get through a slot as narrow as 0.1mm. The starfish then dissolves the mollusc where it lives, absorbing the nutrients. This digestion process takes much longer than opening the shell, perhaps a couple of days.
Some species swallow the shell whole, and dissolve the contents inside their stomach, then push out the shell afterwards.p45
Consequences.
The ability of starfish to eat brachipods and bivalves developed especially in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. The Mesozoic marine revolution transformed the sea-floor fauna. Weakly defended and static shellfish disappeared, and more heavily armoured or more mobile shellfish flourished.
There was a great reproductive advantage for any prey which had even the slightest defence to these predators. Many shellfish developed extra-tough shells. Some burrowed into the sand. Scallops must had had some elementary movement, which developed rapidly under selection. They became extremely common in the Mesozoic. There are some other methods used by a few scallops. "Chlamys hastata" often carry sponges on their shell. It is a kind of mutualism. The sponge makes it difficult for starfish to get their tube feet on, and camouflages "Chlamys hastata" from predators.
When scallops move off the sand they are open to new predators such as rays, which patrol just above the ocean floor. They may also be picked up by seabirds which open shells by dropping them on rock. Evidently the main advantage lies in getting away from the starfish, which are very numerous on inshore and continental shelf habitats.

Tube feet

Tube feet are small tube-like projections on the underside (oral side) of echinoderms. They are part of the water vascular system of echinoderms.
Tube feet are used to move, feed and respiration. They are arranged in grooves along the arms. They operate through hydraulic pressure. They are used to pass food to the oral mouth at the center, and can attach to surfaces. Tube feet allow these animals to stick to the ocean floor and move slowly. A sea star that is overturned simply turns one arm over and attaches it to a solid surface, and levers itself the right way up.
Tube feet are used by starfish are used to open up bivalve shells. The shells of brachiopods and bivalves are held together by strong muscles. What the starfish does is clamp hold of them on either side with its tube feet, and apply a steady pull. The starfish, with its muscles and hydraulic system, can pull for much longer than any bivalve muscle can withstand. Apparently, ten minutes are usually enough to open the shell a bit.

Pincer

Pincers are a hand tool used in many situations where a mechanical advantage is required. They are used to pinch, cut or pull an object. Pincers are first-class levers. Pincers differ from pliers in that the concentration of force is either to a point, or to an edge at a right angle to the handle of the tool. This allows pincers to be brought close to a surface. This is often helpful when removing nails from wood. Pincers are often called end-nippers or end-cutters. Carpenter's pincers are very well suited to these tasks. Pincers are primarily used for removing objects out of a material. 
Pincers, often red-hot, have been used as an instrument of torture since the middle ages or earlier.
Pliers are a similar tool with a different type of head used for squeezing, rather than cutting and pulling.

Korean calendar

The old Korean calendar tells the phases of the moon and the day in the solar year, like other older calendars of other East Asian countries. Dates are calculated from Korea's meridian. Important dates are based in Korean culture.
The Gregorian calendar officially began to be used in 1896. The dates of older important Korean events are still based on the old calendar. The most important date in Korea today is Seollal, the first day of the Korean calendar's New Year. Other important events include Daeboreum (the first full moon phase, also referred to as "Boreumdaal"), Dano (spring) and Chuseok (autumn), and Samjinnal (beginning of spring). Other minor events based on the old Korean calendar include Yudu (summer), and Chilseok (monsoon season).
History.
The old Korean calendar comes from the old Chinese calendar. The Korean calendar said what its years were by using Korean era names from 270 to 963. Then Chinese era names with Korean era names were used a few times until 1894. In 1894-1895, The calendar based on the moon was used with years numbered from the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392.
The Gregorian calendar began to be used on 1 January 1896, with Korean era name "Geonyang (건양 / 建陽, "adopting solar calendar")."
From 1945 to 1961 in South Korea, Gregorian calendar years were counted from the start of Gojoseon in 2333 BC (regarded as year one). These Dangi (단기 / 檀紀) years were 4278 to 4294. This numbering was often used unofficially with the Korean lunar calendar before 1945. It has only sometimes been used after 1961, mostly in North Korea before 1997.
In North Korea, the Juche calendar has been used since 1997 to number its years, based on the birth of Kim Il Sung.

Ambroise Paré

Ambroise Paré (1510-1590) was an important surgeon of the 16th century. He caused a major change in how medicine was practiced. Unlike surgeons before him, he cared about his patients. He worked to promote healing and minimize a patient's pain. His said "I dressed him, God cured him." Paré was a royal surgeon to several French kings including Henri II. He considered by many to be the father of modern surgery.
Career.
Paré was born about 1510 in France. His father was a country artisan. As a youth he was an apprentice to a barber. Then he trained as a barber-surgeon in Paris. This was at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris hospital.
There were three levels of those who practiced medicine. Physicians were at the top and were the only ones who could be members of the Faculty of Medicine. Master surgeons were the next group. Paré belonged to the lowest group, the barber-surgeons. At the time wars were being fought all around him. Battlefield medicine was brutal and dirty. Firearms were a new weapon on the battlefield and were causing new and different wounds. Shrapnel, shot and bullets were a new problem for surgeons. They also believed gunpowder was poisonous. To stop the bleeding, they poured boiling oil over the wound. This burned an already suffering soldier.
In 1536, Paré was a young war surgeon just getting started on the battlefield. He ran out of oil to seal soldiers' wounds after amputations. He made up a mix of egg yolks, oil of roses and turpentine. He applied this to several soldier's wounds. The next morning he was surprised to see those soldiers with the mix he made up were much better than the soldiers who had been scalded. He used ligatures to tie off arteries during amputations to stop bleeding. 
Royal surgeon.
In 1552, Paré became the official royal surgeon. He was surgeon to four French kings: Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III.
Paré wrote his first book, "Methods of Treating Wounds", in 1545. He wrote it in French because he did not speak Latin. In 1575 he published his collected works. He was severely criticized by the Faculty of Physicians. This was the top school of physicians in France. Paré was called an ignorant fraud by Etienne Gourmelen, the dean of the Faculty. He stated no books on medicine could be published except through the Faculty of Physicians. Paré had the support of the king so his books sold without the Faculty. He wrote three more books. Paré wrote his own story titled "The Apology and Treatise of Ambroise Paré".

Productive efficiency

In economics, productive efficiency is a situation in which an economy is not able to produce any more of one good without reducing the production of another good. As resources are limited, it is not possible for more units of a good to be produced without taking away the resources used for producing another good. The concept of productive efficiency can be shown on a production possibility frontier (PPF), where all points on the curve are productively efficient.
Productive efficiency refers to the maximum amount of output that an economy can produce at a certain point in time. However, if firms in the economy were to improve on their production methods and increase productivity, it is possible for the PPF to shift outwards, thus allowing more goods to be produced than before.
Productive inefficiency happens when factors of production (i.e. land, labor, capital or enterprise) are not used to its maximum. For example, labor in the form of workers may be sitting and not doing any work. If the worker were to be used to produce more output than before, then having the worker not doing any work would be productively inefficient.
Allocative efficiency is a special type of productive efficiency in which the right amount of goods is produced to benefit society in the best way.
Model.
Productive efficiency can be shown either by using a production possibility frontier (PPF) diagram, or by using the marginal cost and average total cost curves.
Production possibility frontier.
Assuming that the economy only produces 2 goods – guns and butter. Points B, C and D on the diagram are considered to be productively efficient as it is not possible to produce more of either good without having to reduce the production of the other. For example, if the economy is producing at point D, the only way to produce more butter is to reduce the production of guns, thus reaching point C.
If the economy was originally producing at point A of the diagram, it is possible for more butter and guns to be produced without having to reduce the production of any of them. When this happens, the economy shifts from point A to point D and is better utilizing its resources.
However, if the economy was originally producing at point D and wants to produce more butter, the production of guns would have to be reduced. If the production of guns is not reduced, the economy would produce at point X, which is not possible in reality as there are no resources available to produce the extra output.
Marginal and average total cost.
For a firm that is producing a certain type of good, it would have the marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) curves when producing an additional unit of output as shown in the diagram.
By definition, the MC curve will meet the ATC curve at its minimum point, which is the point P1 and Q1 on the diagram. At this point, producing more than Q1 would bring more costs than benefits to the firm, whereas producing less than Q1 would mean that there are more benefits than costs in producing more of the good. Hence, the point P1 and Q1 would be a point that is just right, and all the resources of the firm would be fully used in the best possible way.
In reality, firms that are less competitive are unlikely to be producing at the productively efficient point as they are earning supernormal profits and have no need to cut costs. These firms are thus considered to be X-inefficient.

He has Bachelor's degree in International Relations. He also has H. Doctorate (2012) from The Higher Academy for Strategic and Security' Studies - HASSS, Sudan and has Kazakhstan Friendship Medal (2014).
Founded TASAM (2003) and established TASAM Publications and Strategic Foresight Journal (2004) and TASAM WORLD Centre for Capacity Building Management and Cooperation (2013).
TASAM, which has been operating in the institutional body of a NGO as a “think tank” for twelve years, has become an international “Turkey Brand”. 
TASAM's activities, which are developed to provide strategic contributions to Turkey’s national institutional capacity building, together with its institutional networks have reached a level of global importance. Around hundreds of leading experts and academics contribute to TASAM’s institutes, platforms, projects and other activities which span nearly 100 countries.
There are 10 foreign policy fields that TASAM acts on. These are continently Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and Caribbean and North America. The regional ones are Balkans, Middle East, Mediterranean and Black Sea - Caucasus which are - in every parameter- the security zone of these four continents in terms of Turkey. Also Turkic World and Islamic World are called as identical fields. 
Activities turn into concrete results by final reports, strategic reports, refereed journals, books, agreements, institutes, networks, platforms and web sites within the extent of studies regarding these fields. Combined with public diplomacy, these results develop a national and international interaction and give effective information, ideas and suggestions to the related decision makers; thus bring about strategic contributions to a Turkey centered perspective on the basis of power and justice.
Also the studies, with three main titles as Macro Process, Strategic Locomotive Sectors and Development of Values, of the “Turkey’s Strategic Vision 2023” Project, which began 7 years ago under the auspices of Turkish Republic and initiative of TASAM, have been keeping on.
Founded seven institutes which are as follows: African Institute (2005), Development and Cooperation Institute (2006), Institute of Islamic Countries (2007), Institute of Political Communication (2008), Institute Public Diplomacy (2009), Environment and Urban Institute (2012), National Defense and Security Institute (2015).

Rhynie

Rhynie () (Scottish Gaelic: "Roinnidh" 
 
) is a village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is 14 miles northwest of Alford.
The Rhynie chert is named after the village, as well as the extinct plant genus Rhynia. The Rhynie chert is a sedimentary rock. It was deposited during the Devonian period and contains the oldest fossil insect in the world.
The Station Hotel at Rhynie is mentioned as a joke in the sketch "The Will" by Scotland the What. The joke is that there is no railway station at Rhynie, "..but they were aye hopin' for one."
History.
Eight Pictish symbol stones have been found at Rhynie. These include the "Rhynie Man", discovered in 1978. It is a six foot tall boulder carved with a bearded man carrying an axe. It may possibly be the Celtic god Esus.
The "Rhynie Man" now stands inside Woodhill House (the headquarters of the Aberdeenshire Council ) in Aberdeen.
In 2011, archaeological excavations at Rhynie, near the site of the "Rhynie Man", dug up a fortified settlement. It dates to the early medieval period. Among the finds at the site were fragments of a late 5th or 6th century Roman amphora. It is the only known example of a Roman amphora from Eastern Britain that dates to the post-Roman period. This must have been imported from the Mediterranean region. It means that the inhabitants of the settlement must have been of high status. Archaeologists have said that the settlement may have been a royal family site where Pictish kings lived.

Silphium

This article covers the plant that was used in classical antiquity; for the modern genus of plants, see Silphium (genus).
Silphium was a plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning and as a medicine. It is also known as silphion, laserwort, or laser. It was the essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene. Most of the coins from Cyrene show a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin (called "laser", laserpicium, or lasarpicium).
Silphium was an important species. The Egyptians and the Minoan civilization of Knossos used a special glyph in their writing for the silphium plant. It was used by most ancient Mediterranean cultures. The Romans considered it "worth its weight in denarii" (silver coins). Legend said that it was a gift from the god Apollo.
Which plant species silphium was is unclear. It is commonly believed to be a now-extinct plant of the genus "Ferula". The still-living plant species "Ferula tingitana" has been suggested as another possibility. Another resin from different "Ferula" species, asafoetida, was used as a cheaper substitute for silphium. Asafoetida is still available.

Koska Helvacısı

Koska Helvacısı or simply Koska is the leading brand and trademark of helva (halva) and Turkish delight production in Turkey.
Name.
Koska was a former quarter of Istanbul, near Laleli. The company takes its name from their old location at Koska. Helvacı means producer or seller of sweets in Turkish. "Koska Helvacısı", then, "Sweetshop of Koska".
History.
Koska's origins go back to the city of Denizli in the early 1900s. It was founded by Hacı Emin Bey.
His son Halil İbrahim Adil Dindar came to Istanbul in 1931. He started a helva production and sale shop at Koska. In 1982, after the death of their father, the heirs, three Dindar brothers, divided the company into two. They made an agreement to continue to use the brand name of Koska, both of them independently. Nevzat and Mümtaz Dindar established "Merter Helva" under the brand name "Koska". Mahir Dindar established "Mahir Gıda" under the brand name "Koska Helvacısı". Thus both companies market(ed) their products using the traditional name "Koska". 
At present.
In 2011, Merter added a "nazar boncuğu" (traditional blue and white bead for good luck) image to its logo, with the aim of differentiating the two companies. This was criticised by Mahir Gıda as a violation of their agreement. They announced that no Koska product bore any signs like bugs, flowers or beads. In return, Merter announces that no Koska product without the image of the "Helvacı Dede" (Granpa Helvacı) is genuine Koska.
Merter Helva drafted a "constitution" or agreement not to have similar divisions in the future. They also received a "kosher food" and a "halal food" certificate.
Both companies produce Turkish delight, fruit preserves and various other sweet confections. This is in addition to the traditional "helva".

The Miracle of Bern

The Miracle of Bern (German: "Das Wunder von Bern" 
 
) is a 2003 movie directed by Sönke Wortmann. It tells the story of a German family (particularly of a young boy and his depressed ex-POW father). It is also about the unexpected West German miracle victory in the 1954 World Cup Final in Bern, Switzerland. The film is a portrait of post-war Germany. With over 6 million visitors, it is one of Germany's best-selling movies.
Plot.
In 1954, Richard (Peter Lohmeyer) returns to his German hometown after seven years as a prisoner of war (ww2). The years have caused some consequences, and he fails to relate to his family. Particularly he does not relate to his soccer-loving son, Matthias (Louis Klamroth). Meanwhile, a journalist (Lukas Gregorowicz) and his wife head to Bern, Switzerland, to write about the World Cup. The stories of these strangers converge when they arrive in Bern. There they witness an uplifting German performance in a game against Hungary.

<doc id="508007" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=508007" title="Mare Nostrum">
Mare Nostrum

Mare Nostrum (Latin for "Our Sea") was a Roman name for the Mediterranean Sea. In the years after the unification of Italy in 1861, the term was used again by Italian nationalists. They believed that Italy should follow on from the Roman Empire.
Use of the term in Roman times.
The term "mare nostrum" was used in the first place by Romans to refer to the Tyrrhenian Sea. This was after they had taken over the countries around it. These were Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. It happened during the Punic Wars with Carthage. By 30 BC, the Romans had taken over the countries around the Mediterranean from the Iberian Peninsula to Egypt. So they started to began to use the name "mare nostrum" for the whole Mediterranean Sea. They used other names as well, such as "Mare Internum" ("The Internal Sea"). However, they did not use the name "Mediterranean" (Middle Sea), as this name came later.
Use by Italian nationalists.
In the 1880's some Italians became interested in nationalism. Other European countries had made colonies in Africa (called the "Scramble for Africa"). They wanted Italy to have African colonies too. The term "mare nostrum" was used again by the Italian poet Emilio Lipi
Even if the coast of Tripoli were a desert, even if it would not support one peasant or one Italian business firm, we still need to take it to avoid being suffocated in "mare nostrum".—Emilio Lupi
Use by Mussolini and the Italian Fascists.
The term was again used by Benito Mussolini for use in fascist propaganda. He used it in the same way that Adolf Hitler used the word "lebensraum" (German for "more space to live in"). It meant they wanted to take over other countries to have more for themselves. Mussolini wanted Italy to be great like the Roman Empire. He believed that Italy was the most powerful Mediterranean country after World War I. He said that "the twentieth century will be a century of Italian power". Mussolini built up a powerful navy so he could control the Mediterranean Sea.
When World War II started, Italy already controlled the north and south shores of the middle part of the Mediterranean. The western part was controlled by Spain and France. The eastern part by Greece, Turkey and the British Empire. In 1940 the fall of France removed the main threat from the west. At the same time Italy invaded Greece and Egypt and attacked the island of Malta. Mussolini talked about making the Mediterranean "an Italian lake". The Axis (Italy and Germany together) defeated Greece, but could not defeat the British in Egypt. For the next three years they fought many battles there (called the Western Desert Campaign). The British and Italian navies also fought at sea (this is called the Battle of the Mediterranean). By 1943 the Axis in North Africa had been beaten and in September 1943 Italy was invaded and forced to surrender.
Use of the term today.
The name "Mare Nostrum" was chosen for a conference by the Society for Mediterranean Law and Culture. It was held in June 2012 at the University of Cagliari in Sardinia. What they meant by the term was the full diversity of Mediterranean cultures, especially for exchanges and cooperation among Mediterranean nations.
After a 2013 shipwreck near Lampedusa when many migrants from Africa had to be rescued. The Italian government increased its patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea. It called this "Operation Mare Nostrum", which was a military and humanitarian operation to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants.

Scottish English

Scottish English, also known as Scottish Standard English or Standard Scottish English (SSE), is a dialect of English that is spoken in Scotland. People can tell Scottish English from British English by their accents, grammar, and vocabulary.
Scottish English should not be confused with Scots, a language which is very much like, but separate from English. The Scots language itself has affected Scottish English by means of contact with the Standard English after the 17th century. Still, many speakers of both Scots and Scottish English put them into different registers and smoothly switch between the two.

Mass surveillance in the United States

The practice of mass surveillance in the United States dates back to wartime monitoring and censorship of international communications from, to, or which passed through the United States. 
After the First World War and the Second World War, the surveillance continued, by programs such as the Black Chamber and Project SHAMROCK. The formation and growth of federal law-enforcement and intelligence agencies such as the FBI, CIA, and NSA helped surveillance, such as the COINTELPRO projects from 1956–1971. 
A series of media reports in 2013 revealed more recent programs and techniques employed by the US intelligence community. Advances in computer and information technology allow the creation of huge national databases that facilitate mass surveillance in the United States.

Duct

In anatomy and physiology, a duct is a tube leading from an exocrine gland or organ. It usually carries the gland's product to where it is used. An example is the vas deferens, which carries sperm to the ejaculatory ducts. Another example is tear ducts, which carry tears to the eye.
Ducts are lined by pavement-type endothelial cells. Outside the endothelium in blood and lymphatic vessels is a layer with no cells called the basement membrane. Outside that are the smooth muscle cells. The smooth muscle squeezes the contents along.

Smooth muscle is muscle inside the body and not attached to bones. It is not under conscious control. Its function is to help the inner workings of the body.
Smooth muscle is found in the walls of blood vessels, vessels of the lymphatic system, the urinary bladder, uterus, male and female reproductive tracts, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, most ducts, and a number of other places such as the iris.
The smooth muscle looks different to the skeletal muscle, and works differently. It can squeeze slowly, and move in waves along a duct. Most types of smooth muscle squeeze gently for a long time, and use little energy. Some smooth muscle squeezes quickly and relaxes in phases.

Epoxy

Epoxy is the end product of epoxy resins. 
It is also a common name for the epoxide functional group, and a common name for a type of strong adhesive used for sticking things together. Typically, two resins need to be mixed together before use. 
Epoxy resins are a class of reactive polymers which contain epoxide groups. Their co-reactants are often called 'hardeners' or 'curatives', and the cross-linking reaction is referred to as 'curing'. The reaction forms a thermosetting polymer, often with strong mechanical properties as well as high temperature and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of industrial applications.

The Pontiac Montana was a minivan sold by the Pontiac Motor Division of General Motors. Before the 1999 model year, it was known as The Pontiac Trans Sport. Since 1997, its most popular trim package had been the 'Montana sport package'. It gave the minivan more SUV-like features. In 1999 Pontiac changed the name of the car line to the 'Pontiac Montana'. Pontiac wanted to change to a more sporty performance image. But the change put it in direct competition with the Oldsmobile Silhouette and the Chevrolet Venture. For 2005, the van was redesigned. It had a higher, less aerodynamic nose to resemble an SUV. The Montana name was changed to Montana SV6 in 2006. 
No more improvements were made to the Montana models after the 2005 model year. Pontiac stopped selling them after the 2006 model year in the United States. They continued to be sold in Canada and Mexico until the 2009 model year. GM discontinued the Pontiac division after the 2010 model year. The Pontiac minivans were General Motors' most popular minivans in Canada. The Doraville, Georgia assembly plant which produced the Montana closed on September 26, 2009.. The Montana was replaced by GM's Lambda crossover SUVS . Strangely it wasn't replaced by a Pontiac version of the crossovers.

History of Florida

The history of Florida began when the first Native Americans came to live in the peninsula, 14,000 years ago. They left behind artifacts and archeological evidence. 
Written history begins with the arrival of Europeans to Florida. In 1513, the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León kept the first records. Florida was the first part of the United States to be settled by Europeans. Thus, 1513 marked the beginning of the American Frontier. St. Augustine, Florida is the oldest continually occupied settlement in the United States. From 1565, it was founded by European and African-American settlers. But the site is even older as St. Augustine was built where there had been an ancient Native American village.

Cape flower region

The Cape flower region is a nature area near the south end of South Africa. 
The region is the smallest of the six "flower kingdoms" of the world, as recognised by Ronald Good. Its formal title is the Cape (South Africa) Floristic Region.
The region has very high diversity. Many kinds of plants are found there. Most of them are unique. There are more than 9,000 vascular plant species. Sixty-nine of them are found only there. 
Much of this diversity is because of the fynbos, a Mediterranean-type shrubland that can easily be destroyed by wildfires. The economic worth of the fynbos area may be about R77 million a year from harvests of products (like wildflowers) and from eco-tourism. The Cape flower region has both economic and biological value. It is a good place to look for many kinds of plants, insects, small animals and other creatures in nature.

Red kite

The red kite ("Milvus milvus") is a medium-large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. This family also has other raptors such as eagles, buzzards, and harriers. 
The species is found all over Europe and northwest Africa. It is resident in the milder parts of its range in western Europe and northwest Africa, but birds from northeastern and central Europe winter further south and west, reaching south to Turkey.
Red kites eat small mammals and carrion. They were wiped out in most of Britain, except for a few in south Wales. Farmers killed them, and so did the DDT picked up from their prey. They have made a big come-back in England and Scotland after they were recently re-introduced.
A sighting of the first red kite in London for 150 years was reported in "The Independent" newspaper in January 2006. In June 2006, the UK-based Northern Kites Project reported that kites had bred in the Derwent Valley, Tyne and Wear for the first time since the re-introduction.

Zip-line

A zip-line (also called a zip line, zip wire, aerial runway, aerial ropeslide, death slide or Tyrolean crossing) is a device that allows a person to slide down an inclined wire or rope. The process uses gravity to propel the user. You can be stopped by dragging your feet or by water. Often a pulley is used suspended on a cable, usually made of stainless steel. Zip-lines are often used for entertainment. Some are short and low designed for children on a playground. Zip-lines are often used as a means of getting to remote areas, such as a rainforest canopy or crossing a river. 
History.
The zip-wire has been used as a way to get around in some mountainous countries for over 2,000 years. Since the 1700s they have been used in places like Europe, China and the Himalayas. In the Australian outback, zip-lines were occasionally used for delivering food, cigarettes or tools. They were useful for people working on the other side of an obstacle such as a gully or river. Australian soldiers have used them to bring ammunition to forward positions during wars.
During World War II the United States discovered they were behind the Russians and the Germans in using parachutes to deploy soldiers quickly. In setting up training the army decided to use drop towers with zip lines to simulate a parachute landing. It was a success and has been used since that time to train airborne forces.
Costa Rica claims to be the birthplace of modern zip-line tours. Graduate students, John Williams and Donald Perry were rock-climbers who were in Costa Rica studying botanical (plants) and entomological (insects) subjects. They used their rock climbing equipment to climb trees. When they used lines to get down or move to lower trees, other students did too. Soon tours started in Costa Rica for entertainment.
Zip-line tours.
Zip-line tours are becoming popular vacation activities. Some are as short as 100 feet while others may be as long as a mile. The jungles of Costa Rica, Florida, Puerto Vallarta,and Nicaragua are popular places for those interested in experiencing zip-lines. Since 2000, the number of zip-line tours in the United States has grown to over 200. Zip-line tours are not available at places such as Santa Catalina Island, Big Bear and the San Diego Zoo in California. Prices vary for the ride. The San Diego Zoo ride costs $112 (for two lines). At the Santa Paula, California KOA the cost is $10 for an 800 foot long zip-line. At Durango Colorado there are 27 zip lines totaling 1.5 mi. The tour lasts for five hours. 
In Sun City, South Africa the Zip 2000 is one of the world's longest zip lines at over 1 mi in length. The world's longest zip-line tour is "Miss Sky Canopy Tour" in Nosara, Costa Rica. It runs for 7 mi and is made up of 21 runs. Taihape, New Zealand has one of the fastest zip-lines (called flying foxes locally) with speeds at over 100 mi/h.

Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate

The debate between Bill Nye and Ken Ham on the question "Is Creation A Viable Model of Origins?" was held February 4, 2014. The even took place at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky. Ham is the founder and chief executive officer of the Young Earth creationist (YEC) ministry Answers in Genesis (AiG). He challenged Nye, science educator. Nye is best known for hosting the 1990s television series "Bill Nye the Science Guy". This happened after Ham took exception to a YouTube video. Nye was talking about a large number of people in the US do not accept the theory of evolution. Tickets to the event sold out within minutes. The televised event drew over three million viewers. Debates such as this one have been going on since Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of Species" in 1859.
The debate.
Nye stepped onto the stage in front of a hostile audience. It wasn't Nye's first time debating. Since his show on PBS ended in 1998, he has been making speaking tours at colleges and universities. He has also appeared on several cable television programs. It was Ham's home turf. Ham is the head of the museum as well as the Christian outreach organization called Answers in Genesis. He argued the Bible was the ultimate authority on natural history. During the debate, Ham talked about his model of the universe's origins. Nye cited observations from a variety of scientific fields to defend the majority scientific consensus that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old.
Science versus creationism.
Bill Nye said that "Creation is bad for science." Ken Ham then referred to several scientists who were young earth creationists. Ham asked Nye how he could explain the laws of logic and physics in a naturalistic worldview. Ham asked Nye for an example of something that could only have been invented from an evolutionary worldview. He also showed the difference between what's called historical science and observational science. Ham gave an example of biological adaptation. He brought up "Tiktaalik" as an example of a scientific prediction. He added, "Mr. Ham and his worldview does not have this capability". Ham claimed the mainstream scientific community has made creationists afraid to speak out. He went on to say they need "scientific freedom" to speak.
Dating.
Nye offered several objections to Ham's young-earth position. He stated that ice cores and tree rings show that a young earth view is wrong. Nye also offered radiometric and carbon-14 dating to show that a young earth view is wrong. Ham disagreed; he called radioactive dating "assumptions".
 He said the only authority was the word of God, the Bible. Ham stated he saw two kinds of science. One called "observational science" which is science that can be observed. The second he termed “historical science" meaning fossil records and similar artifacts. Ham stated "I assert that the word 'science' has been hijacked by secularists in teaching evolution to force the religion of naturalism on generations of kids".
The results.
Many scientists were critical of Nye for accepting Ham's invitation. They claimed his participation in the debate gave Ham's views undeserved legitimacy. Two humanist groups—the American Humanist Association and the Center for Inquiry praised Nye's decision. Scientists from both camps generally agreed that Nye won the debate. However they did not agree on how convincing the victory was. Ham later announced that the publicity from the debate helped fundraising for AiG's planned Ark Encounter theme park. It allowed the ministry to begin construction.
A related book by Bill Nye, "Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation", was just released. Ken Ham released a book after the debate titled "Inside the Nye Ham debate: is Creation a viable model: revealing truths from the worldview clash of the century".

Horneophyton

Horneophyton is a genus of early Devonian fossil land plants. Its fossils are very common in the Rhynie chert. Both the sporophyte and a female gametophyte have been found as fossils. The sporophyte was about 20 cm tall, and the gametophyte was about 6 cm tall. It is not really a vascular plant. It had vascular tissue but the cells had thin walls.
"Horneophyton" had anatomy similar to the hornworts. It is also similar to the vascular plant "Rhynia" which lived at the same time. It might therefore be a missing link between the Bryophytes like hornworts and the vascular plants like "Rhynia".

Greenfield controversy.
From 1998 to 8 January 2010, the Director of the Royal Institution was Baroness Susan Greenfield, but following a review, the position was abolished for being "no longer affordable". The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a £22m development programme led by Greenfield, which included refurbishment of the institution's main Albemarle Street building, and the addition of a restaurant and bar with an aim to turn the venue into a "Groucho club for science". The project ended £3 million in debt.
Greenfield subsequently announced that she would be suing for discrimination.
The RI's official statement stated it would "continue to deliver its main charitable objectives under the direction of chief executive officer, Chris Rofe and a talented senior team including Professor Quentin Pankhurst, the Director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory, Dr Gail Cardew, the Head of Programmes and Professor Frank James, Head of Collections and Heritage". Baroness Greenfield later dropped the discrimination case.

Jim Gilmore

James Stuart "Jim" Gilmore III (born October 6, 1949) is an American politician. He was the 68th Governor of Virginia from 1998 to 2002. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Gilmore ran for President of the United States in 2008, but lost the primaries to John McCain. Gilmore announced this launch for his 2016 United States presidential campaign on July 30, 2015.
Early life.
Gilmore was born in Richmond, Virginia. His parents were Margaret Evelyn (née Kandle), a church secretary, and James Stuart Gilmore, Jr., a grocery store meat cutter. He graduated from John Randolph Tucker High School and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia in 1971.
Early career.
Gilmore was elected Commonwealth's Attorney of his native Henrico County in 1987 and 1991, and then was first elected to statewide office in 1993 as Virginia's Attorney General. Gilmore resigned in 1997 to run for Governor, also joining the law firm of LeClairRyan as a partner.
Governor of Virginia (1998-2002).
Gilmore was elected Governor of Virginia in 1997, winning 56% of the vote to Beyer's 43%. He was inaugurated on January 17, 1998.
In his first year as Governor, Gilmore pushed for car tax reduction legislation that was eventually passed by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly. Gilmore signed an executive order reducing state spending by all agencies, except for education, to keep the state's budget balanced during the economic downturn.
In 1999, Gilmore proposed and signed into law legislation that reduced tuitions at public colleges and universities by 20%. Gilmore created the nation's first state Secretary of Technology. As Governor, Gilmore signed into law legislation establishing a 24-hour waiting period and informed consent for women seeking an abortion, as well as a ban against partial birth abortion.
The Virginia Constitution forbids any Governor from serving consecutive terms, so Gilmore could not run for a second term in 2001. He was succeeded by Democrat Mark Warner, who took office in early 2002.
2008 Senate campaign.
In the November election, Gilmore was defeated, winning only 34 percent of the vote to Warner's 65 percent. Gilmore only carried four counties in the state – Rockingham, Augusta, Powhatan and Hanover. In many cases, he lost in many areas of the state that are normally reliably Republican.
2008 presidential campaign.
On December 19, 2006, Gilmore announced he would form an exploratory committee to "fill the conservative void" in the race. On January 9, 2007, Gilmore officially filed papers with the Federal Election Commission to form the Jim Gilmore for President Exploratory Committee.
On July 14, 2007, Gilmore announced that he was ending his campaign. Gilmore said that it would be "impractical" to run, citing the difficulty of raising enough money to be competitive in early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.
2016 presidential campaign.
 relarticle mainpage">Main : Jim Gilmore presidential campaign, 2016
Gilmore announced that he will run for president in his second presidential campaign for the 2016 presidential election on July 30, 2015.

Mahogany

Mahogany is a hard tropical wood from the Americas. It was discovered by Europeans early in the 16th century (~1514). The wood comes from a tree, "Swietenia mahagoni". The tree is native to southern Florida and islands in the Caribbean including the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.
At first, mahogany was used by the Spanish and English to build ships. 
Mark Catesby's "Natural History" explains why: 
"[Mahogany] has properties for that use excelling oak, and all other wood, viz. durableness, resisting gunshots, and burying the shot without splintering".
The second use for mahogany was to make furniture. The Spanish were first to do this, but in the 18th and early 19th century it was much used by English workshops. This period is called "Age of Mahogany". Also much furniture in mahogany was made in France and other European countries.

Death hoax

 
A death hoax is a false report of someone's death.
In some cases, it might be because the person has faked their own death on purpose. In some cases they are mistakes while in most cases, they are intentional. Hoaxes are designed to play on other people's emotions. Sometimes, a death hoax is designed to be a practical joke; however, most are to give the person starting the rumor a sense of power over their victims. 
There are often consequences when the person who started the hoax is discovered. The news media has to be especially careful of hoaxes, including death hoaxes. While some people will believe anything, most people resent being tricked. However, it depends on how the story is handled: For example, a death hoax ran in Canadian papers about a hard-drinking, hard-swearing Carcross Parrot who had just died; most forgave the writers since the story was published on April Fools' Day. 
Mark Twain is one of the most famous people to be the subject of a death hoax. In his case, the newspapers were just careless. This is when he uttered his famous quote, "The report of my death was an exaggeration." It has often been misquoted as "reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated".

First Peoples (documentary)

 
First Peoples is a 2015 television documentary about the first people on the continents of the Earth. The five-part PBS series covers each continent or group of continents one at a time. The focus is on very recent work in paleogenomics (the study of genomes from very long ago). It was produced by Wall to Wall Television. The series challenges the East African origin theory of modern man showing there were other origins in other parts of Africa.
A two-disk DVD of the documentary was made in 2015. 
Episodes.
1. "First Peoples: Americas" discusses the idea that the first people coming into the Americas traveled along the western coast thousands of years before the Clovis people. The episode begins with a lengthy discussion on Kennewick Man and what his DNA reveals about him.
2. "First Peoples: Africa" argues that that "Homo sapiens" emerged in various parts of Africa about 200,000 years ago. This episode discusses the Jebel Irhoud skull found in Morocco. It also discusses evidence of other humans in West and Central Africa. 
3. "First Peoples: Asia" presents evidence and arguments for a mixture of Neanderthal, Denisovan and "Homo erectus" genes in humans' as they moved east. It emphasized man's need to explore. Because of that need they encountered other peoples. Modern human DNA shows the earliest "Homo sapiens" interbred with other human species such as Neanderthals.
4. "First Peoples: Australia" discusses evidence for the first Australians coming across the ocean around 43,000 BP (Before Radiocarbon dating began in 1950). This program explores the close connections between the first people and modern-day Australian Aborigines. 
5. "First Peoples: Europe" discusses the arrival of humans in Europe and why they dominated competing "Homo" species. It highlights the explosion of art in Europe that came with the "Homo sapiens".

Aglaophyton

Aglaophyton is a genus of early Devonian fossil land plants. Its fossils have been found in the Rhynie chert. Only the sporophyte generation have been found as fossils. Only one species has been found, "Aglaophyton major". 
Relationship to other plants.
"Aglaophyton" was at first thought to be a species of the vascular plant genus "Rhynia" which lived at the same time. Later it was discovered that it is not really a vascular plant. It had vascular tissue, but the cells had thin walls. It might therefore be a missing link between the Bryophytes and "Horneophyton" and the vascular plants like "Rhynia".
In 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram which has "Aglaophyton" as the sister group of the vascular plants.

Nikau

The nīkau ("Rhopalostylis sapida") is a palm tree endemic to New Zealand. It is the only palm tree to grow there. It also does not grow naturally anywhere else in the world.
"Nīkau" is a Māori word. In the languages of the Pacific tropics, it means the leaves of a coconut palm. 
The Maori had many uses for the nīkau palm. The bases of the inner leaves and the young flowers were eaten raw or cooked. Food was wrapped in the leaves for cooking. The old tough leaves were used to make baskets, floor rugs and waterproof thatched roofs for buildings.
Natural location.
The nīkau palm lives along the coast and lowland forests on the North Island and on the South Island. It lives where there is humidity. It is the world's most southern palm at 44° 18'S latitude.
Description.
The nīkau grows tall with a wide, green trunk which has grey-green leaf scars. The trunk is topped by a smooth, bulging crown of fronds (leaves). The flowers are coloured lilac to pink. The fruit is circular or oblong and is red when ripe. The nīkau has flowers between November and April (summer). The fruit ripens from February to November and is a favourite food for the native wood pigeon.
Caring for the palm.
The nīkau makes an excellent potted plant, and is quite healthy. It is slow-growing. It grows easily from a seed if the fruit is soaked in water for a few days and then gently scrubbed to remove the skin. The seed will then germinate in sealed plastic bags in part shade. Later, they can be planted in deep pots. 
The nīkau lives well in cool temperatures. In New Zealand, it does not get exposed to freezing weather. It can survive a few degrees of frost. It is hurt most by a sudden large drop in temperature even above freezing. It does well in areas with a mild Mediterranean climate.

Great Stink

The Great Stink was in central London in July and August 1858. During hot weather the smell of untreated faeces was overpowering.
It was caused by untreated human waste in the River Thames, and on its banks. An ageing and inadequate sewer system emptied directly into the Thames. 
The bad air was thought to transmit contagious diseases. There were three outbreaks of cholera before the Great Stink was blamed on the problems with the river. A proposal from the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette for sewage treatment was finally accepted.

Cracked Rear View is the major-label debut album by Hootie & the Blowfish. It was released on July 5, 1994 by Atlantic Records.
Reception.
"Cracked Rear View" is Hootie & the Blowfish's most successful album. It was the highest-selling album of 1995, with 10.5 million shipments that year alone. It eventually shipped 16 million copies by March 31, 1999. "Cracked Rear View" reached number one on the "Billboard" 200 five times during 1995. The album also reached number one in Canada and New Zealand. Three million copies were sold through the Columbia House mail-order system.
Critical reviews of "Cracked Rear View" were mostly positive. The Allmusic review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it four and a half stars out of five. He wrote that it was "the success story of 1994/1995." He also said, "Although Hootie & the Blowfish aren't innovative, they deliver the goods. They turned out an album of solid, rootsy folk-rock songs that have simple, powerful hooks."

<doc id="508970" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=508970" title="Hybrid vigour">
Hybrid vigour

Hybrid vigour (or hybrid vigor) is the improved activity and survival of hybrid offspring. The technical term in genetics is heterosis. 
Inbreeding in a normal population leads to the offspring getting worse, less fit, less fertile and usually not living as long as the parents. The opposite, outbreeding, leads to fit, healthy, fertile offspring. This effect has been known for a long time. Animal breeders have known it since the 18th century, and Darwin investigated it in detail with plants.
On the other hand, when two parents are from widely different populations, such as different subspecies, this usually does not apply. In that case it is more usual for the hybrids to have lower fitness. Mules are usually not fertile, and that automatically makes then of lower fitness, as that term is used in biology. They are very hardy animals, but they leave few offspring. The puzzle for scientists has been to explain these facts. 
Genetic theories.
When a population is small or inbred, it tends to lose genetic diversity. The loss of fitness is due to loss of genetic diversity. Inbred strains tend to be homozygous for recessive alleles. Recessive alleles tend to be mildly harmful. Heterosis or hybrid vigor, on the other hand, is the tendency of outbred strains to exceed both inbred parents in fitness.
In the early 20th century, after Mendel's laws came to be understood and accepted, two explanations were proposed.
Present status.
At present, the first idea seems to fit the facts best. "The current view ... is that the dominance hypothesis is the major explanation of inbreeding decline and the high yield of hybrids".
An epigenetic effect heterosis has been found in plants, and also in animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which repress the translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or degrade mRNAs. The miRNAs may also have an effect on hybrid vigour.

India (cat)

India "Willie" Bush (July 13, 1990 – January 4, 2009) was the pet cat of U.S. President George W. Bush and his family while he was in the White House. She lived with the Bush family for almost two decades.
Biography.
The Bushes got India, an all black, female American Shorthair, as a kitten in late 1991 or 1992. Their twin daughters Barbara and Jenna Bush were nine years old. It is not known if the cat had registered to vote. India stayed with George and Laura Bush after Jenna and Barbara left for college. When George W. Bush became President in early 2001, India moved with the family from the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas to the White House.
Even while living at the White House, India did not get as much attention from the media as the family's Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. She is shown in the "Barneycam" videos made by the White House staff at Christmas. She first starred in "Where in the White House is Miss Beazley?", where she was called by her nickname, "Willie". The dogs were always more interesting to the White House press during the Bush presidency. They became more famous to the public.
India (as "Willie") was shown in the March 2008 "Architectural Digest", in the East Sitting Hall of the White House.
Controversy.
There was controversy reported in the news in India. Some people were upset with the cat's name. In July 2004, demonstrations were held in the southern Keralian city of Thiruvananthapuram. The cat's name was criticised as an insult to the nation of India. An effigy of President Bush was burned in protest. 
The Bushes did not change the cat's name because of the demonstrations. India had been named for a baseball player, Rubén Sierra. He was nicknamed "El Indio" while playing for the Texas Rangers, when Bush owned the baseball team. The name had been given to the family cat by Barbara, one of the Bush's daughters.
Death.
India died at the White House on January 4, 2009, at age 18. In a statement to the press about India's death, Sally McDonough, speaking for First Lady Laura Bush, said that the family was "deeply saddened" by their cat's death. Part of the statement said, "India was a beloved member of the Bush family for almost two decades. She will be greatly missed."

Peace be upon him (Islam)

Peace be upon him (PBUH) or ʿalayhi as-salām (SAAS) is a phrase religious muslims say whenever they refer to the name of the prophet Muhammad. Peace be upon him is the English language translation of "alayhi as-salām". In any language it is a sign of great respect and honor. It is also used whenever saying the name of others seen as great prophets (Jesus, Moses, etc.). Muslims say or write the phrase to get Allah's blessings for Muhammad, and in turn, get blessings for themselves. The abbreviations PBUH and SAAS are used in writing in the Muslim world in private and sometimes government documents. The Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, commands this respect be given. The Qur'an 33:56 says "God and his angles send blessings on the Prophet. O you who believe! Send blessings on him, and salute him with all respect." PBUH is a reminder for Muslims to follow his teachings and to be like Muhammad in everything they say and do.

The Shadow

The Shadow is a collection of serialized dramas, originally in 1930s pulp novels, and then in a wide variety of media. Details of the title character have varied across various media. But The Shadow is generally a crime-fighter who works alone instead of with the police. He usually has psychic powers. He poses as a "wealthy, young man about town". The Shadow is one of the most famous adventure heroes of the twentieth century. He has been featured on the radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five motion pictures. The radio drama is well-remembered for those episodes voiced by Orson Welles.
The Shadow first appeared on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the Street and Smith radio program "Detective Story Hour". After gaining popularity among the show's listeners, the narrator became the star of "The Shadow Magazine" on April 1, 1931, a pulp series created and primarily written by Gibson.
On September 26, 1937, "The Shadow" radio drama began with the story "The Deathhouse Rescue," in which The Shadow was characterized as having "the power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him." As in the magazine stories, The Shadow was not given the literal ability to become invisible.
The introduction from "The Shadow" radio program "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!" was spoken by actor Frank Readick Jr.. American English speakers often have heard of this phrase, even if they have never listened to the radio show. These words were accompanied by an ominous laugh and a musical theme, Camille Saint-Saëns' "Le Rouet d'Omphale" ("Omphale's Spinning Wheel", composed in 1872). At the end of each episode The Shadow reminded listeners that, "The weed of crime bears bitter fruit. Crime does not pay... The Shadow knows!"

Geoid

The geoid is a shape like the surface of the Earth. It is a 3-D geometrical shape like an orange. Shapes of this kind are called oblate spheroids, which is a kind of ellipsoid. 
The geoid, however, is a very special kind of oblate spheroid. It is defined as follows:
It was defined by Gauss, nearly two hundred years ago. It is often described as the true physical shape of the Earth. The study of Earth's measurements and shapes is called geodesy.
For many practical purposes, a simpler shape is used because that makes calculations easier. That shape is called a reference ellipsoid. In basic education, the shape of the Earth is described as being like an orange, a sphere but wider round the equator. This shape is produced by all celestial spinning spheres, such as stars and planets. The details differ somewhat in each individual case.

Average annual temperatures ranges from 40°F (4.4°C) in Old Forge in upstate New York to 56°F (13.3°C) in New York City at LaGuardia Airport. 
New York City is an urban heat island, with temperatures 5-7 degrees Fahrenheit (3-4 degrees Celsius) warmer overnight than surrounding areas. In an effort to fight this warming, roofs of buildings are being painted white across the city in an effort to increase the reflection of solar energy, or albedo. NYC has a humid subtropical climate ("Cfa" in the Koeppen climate classification). 
Precipitation vary from around 32 inches in Rochester to 60 inches in the higher elevation of central New York. In the winter, New York has nor'easters which can bring blizzard conditions. Snowfall can range from 24 inches around New York City to over 100 inches in Buffalo and Syracuse.

University of St Andrews

The University of St Andrews (St Andrews University or St Andrews) is a public research university in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. 
It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland, and the third oldest university in the English-speaking world (after Oxford and Cambridge). St Andrews was founded between 1410 and 1413, when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy.
St Andrews is made up from a variety of institutions, including three constituent colleges (United College, St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College) and 18 academic Schools organized into four Faculties. 
The university occupies historic and modern buildings throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two terms, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town's population is either a staff member or student of the university. 
The student body is diverse: over 45% of its intake come from over 100 countries outside of the UK, with about one-eighth of the students from the rest of the EU and the remaining third from overseas – 15% from North America alone. The university's sport teams compete in BUCS competitions, and the student body is keeps ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of distinctive academic dress.
National league tables currently rank St Andrews as the third best university in the United Kingdom, behind Oxbridge. "The Guardian" ranks the Schools of Physics and Astronomy, International Relations, Computer Science, Geography and Mathematics as first in the United Kingdom. The Complete University Guide ranks Divinity and Middle Eastern and African Studies first. "The Times" Higher Education World Universities Ranking names St Andrews among the world’s Top 20 Arts and Humanities universities. St Andrews has the highest student satisfaction (joint first) amongst all multi-faculty universities in the United Kingdom.
St Andrews has many notable former students and staff. Recent alumni include the former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond; Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon; HM British Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward; United States Ambassador to Hungary Colleen Bell; Olympic gold medalist Chris Hoy; and royals Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Six Nobel Laureates are amongst St Andrews' alumni and former staff: two in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine, and one each in Peace and Literature.

Catadioptric sensor

A catadioptric sensor is a visual sensor that contains mirrors and lenses. Video cameras are limited as to how much they can see in one view. They can lose sight of what they are recording if something causes them to move suddenly. Mirrors can be carefully arranged with lenses to allow the camera lens to see a much wider field of view. They are often used in robotics. One example is a catadioptric sensor used to inspect the inside of a cylindrical pipe.

Edward Higgins "Ed" White II (November 14, 1930 – January 27, 1967) was an American test pilot and astronaut. He was the first American to take a "spacewalk," leaving the safety of his spaceship while in space and moving around outside in a spacesuit.
On June 3, 1965, White flew into space as pilot of Gemini 4. This was the second trip by astronauts in NASA's Project Gemini. White was able to get out of his spaceship in outer space, an activity called a spacewalk, then get back in and come home. (The Soviet Union had already done that earlier in the same year.) The trip lasted until June 7, 1965.
White died along with fellow astronauts Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee during a test for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (then known as Cape Kennedy), Florida.

Test pilot

A test pilot is a person who drives an aircraft (such as an airplane or spacecraft) in ways that allow the aircraft to be tried out. The methods a test pilot uses to try out an aircraft are called "flight test techniques" (FTTs). The pilot uses the FTTs to find out if the aircraft works well or not.
Test pilots may work for the military or for a company. Flying military aircraft in order to test them is the most difficult and dangerous kind of flying other than flying in war.
In the 1950s, one test pilot died in an accident every week or so, but many fewer die today. This is because aircraft technology has been improved and because more testing is done on the ground rather than in the air. Also, unmanned aerial vehicles are now often used for testing. Still, the job of test pilot is more dangerous than other jobs for pilots.
A test pilot must be able to:
Test pilots must know about aerospace engineering in order to know how and why planes are tested. They must be more skilled than most other pilots.
History.
Test flying became important during World War I, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in the United Kingdom. During the 1920s, more test flying was done by the RAE in the United Kingdom, and by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in the United States. In the 1950s, NACA changed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Test flying became more scientific during these years.
The world's oldest school for test pilots is the Empire Test Pilots' School at MoD Boscombe Down in the United Kingdom. In America, the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School is at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The United States Naval Test Pilot School is at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The school for test pilots in France is the École du personnel navigant d'essais et de réception (EPNER) in Istres, France. The only test pilot school for civilian (non-military) pilots in the United States is the National Test Pilot School in Mojave, California.

Volcanoes of South America

The volcanoes of South America are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Most of them are along the backbone of the Andes. 
The Andes, together with the volcanoes, has been produced by the movement of the Americas towards the west. This has been happening for a long time, certainly 60 million years or more. This continental drift leads to subduction of oceanic plates beneath the continental plates of the land mass. In turn, this produced the mountain ranges (orogeny) and the volcanic activity.
A rather different cause is at work on the Galápagos Islands. There, a hotspot under the plate casused the islands and their volcanoes to rise up from the sea floor.
Andes.
Bolivia.
The country of Bolivia hosts numerous active and extinct volcanoes across its territory. The active volcanoes are located in western Bolivia where they make up the western limit of the Altiplano plateau. Many of the active volcanoes are international mountains shared with Chile. Apart from Andean volcanoes, Bolivia has the remants of ancient volcanoes around the Precambrian Guaporé Shield in the eastern part of the country.
Chile.
Earthquake activity in Chile is related to subduction of the Nazca Plate to the east. Chile notably holds the record for the largest earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Villarrica, one of Chile's most active volcanoes, rises above Villarrica Lake and the town of Villarrica. It is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes that trend perpendicular to the Andean chain. A 6-km wide caldera formed during the late Pleistocene, >0.9 million years ago.
The Llaima Volcano is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Chile. It is situated 82 km northeast of Temuco and 663 km southeast of Santiago, within the borders of Conguillío National Park. Llaima’s activity has been documented since the 17th century, and consists of several separate episodes of moderate explosive eruptions with occasional lava flows. The last major eruption occurred in 1994.
Chile has experienced numerous volcanic eruptions from 60 volcanoes, including Llaima Volcano and the Chaitén Volcano.
Lascar Volcano is a stratovolcano, is the most active volcano of the northern Chilean Andes. The largest eruption of Lascar took place about 26,500 years ago. Frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions have been recorded from Lascar in historical time since the mid-19th century.
Villarrica, is one of only five volcanoes worldwide known to have an active lava lake inside its crater. The volcano usually generates strombolian eruptions, with ejection of fiery pyroclasts and lava flows. Melting of snow and glacier ice as well as rainfalls often cause massive lahars (mud and debris flows), such as during the eruptions of 1964 and 1971.
Ecuador.
Cotopaxi is a stratovolcano in the Andes Mountains, about 50 km south of Quito, Ecuador, South America. It is the second highest summit in the country, reaching a height of 5897 m. Some consider it the world's highest active volcano. Others give this status to the much higher Llullaillaco, which most recently erupted in 1877 and is one of Ecuador's most active volcanoes. Since 1738, Cotopaxi has erupted more than 50 times, resulting in the creation of numerous valleys formed by lahars (mudflows) around the volcano.
In October 1999, Pichincha Volcano erupted in Quito and covered the city with several inches of ash. Before that, the last major eruptions were in 1553 and in 1660, when about 30 cm of ash fell on the city.
At 5230 meters, Sangay Volcano is an active [stratovolcano] in central Ecuador. It is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world and one of Ecuador's most active ones, erupting three times in recorded history. It shows mostly Strombolian activity. The most recent eruption, which started in 1934, is still ongoing. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern bound of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000 year old history is one of instability. Two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today. Sangay is one of two active volcanoes located in the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. The Park has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983.
Reventador is an active stratovolcano which lies in the eastern Andes of Ecuador. Since 1541 it has erupted over 25 times with most recent eruption in 2009, but the largest historical eruption occurred in 2002. During that eruption the plume from the volcano reached a height of 17 km and pyroclastic flows went up to 7 km from the cone. On March 30, 2007, the mountain spewed ash again. The ash reached a height of about two miles (3 km, 11,000 ft). No injuries or damages have been reported.
Galápagos Islands.
The Galápagos Islands are an isolated set of volcanoes, consisting of shield volcanoes and lava plateaus, 1200 km west of Ecuador. They are driven by the Galápagos hotspot, and are between 4.2 million and 700,000 years of age. The largest island, Isabela Island, consists of six coalesced shield volcanoes, each delineated by a large summit caldera. Española, the oldest island, and Fernandina, the youngest, are also shield volcanoes, as are most of the other islands in the chain. The Galápagos Islands are perched on a large lava plateau known as the Galápagos Platform. This platform creates a shallow water depth of 360 to at the base of the islands, which stretch over a 174 mi-long diameter. 
Since Charles Darwin's famous visit to the islands in 1835, there have been over 60 recorded eruptions in the islands, from six different shield volcanoes. Of the 21 emergent volcanoes, 13 are considered active.
Blue Hill is a shield volcano on the south western part of Isabela Island in the Galápagos Islands and is one of the most active in the Galapagos, with the last eruption between May and June 2008. The Galápagos islands are geologically young for such a big chain, and the pattern of their rift zones follows one of two trends, one north-northwest, and one east-west. The composition of the lavas of the Galápagos shields are strikingly similar to those of the Hawaiian volcanoes.
How exactly the islands were formed remains a geological mystery, although several theories have been fronted. Black Mountain is a large shield volcano at the South eastern end of Isabela Island in the Galapagos that rises to an altitude of 1124m. It coalesces with the volcanoes Cerro Azul to the west and Alcedo to the north. The volcano is one of the most active in the Galapagos, with the last eruption starting on 22 October 2005 and lasting until 30 October 2005.
Alcedo Volcano is one of the six coalescing shield volcanoes that make up Isabela Island in the Galapagos. The remote location of the volcano has meant that even the most recent eruption in 1993 was not recorded until two years later. 
Fernandina Island (formerly known in English as Narborough Island, after John Narborough) is the third largest, and youngest, island of the Galápagos Islands. Like the others, the island was formed by the Galápagos hotspot. The island is an active shield volcano that has been erupting since April 11, 2009.
Peru.

Priming (psychology)

Priming is an implicit memory effect in which exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another stimulus. Experiments in the early 1970s showed that people were faster recognising a word, when the word followed a related word. For example, NURSE is recognized more quickly following DOCTOR than following BREAD. Activation spreading among related ideas was the best explanation for this effect. In experiments the same target stimuli can be presented with different primes. This allows the priming effect to be measured. 
Priming can occur following perceptual, semantic, or conceptual stimulus repetition. For example, if a person reads a list of words including the word "table", and is later asked to complete a word starting with "tab", the probability that he or she will answer "table" is greater than if they are not primed. Another example is if people see an incomplete sketch they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture, later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time.
Priming effects are independent of simple recognition memory. Unconscious priming effects can affect word choice on a word-stem completion test long after the words have been consciously forgotten.
Priming works best when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities, or between semantically related words such as "doctor" and "nurse".

Implicit memory

Implicit memory is a part of memory where previous experiences of how to do a task helps with doing the task again. Implicit memory is unconscious memory: the person or animal performing the task is not aware of the presence of implicit memory. 
Evidence for implicit memory occurs in priming, a process where subjects are measured by how they have improved their performance on tasks for which they have been subconsciously prepared. Implicit memory also leads to the illusion-of-truth effect. Subjects are more likely to say statements that they have already heard are true, regardless of their actual truth. In daily life, people rely on implicit memory every day in the form of procedural memory. This is the kind of memory which allows people to remember how to tie their shoes or ride a bicycle without consciously thinking about these activities. Research into implicit memory indicates that it operates through a different mental process than explicit memory.

The Bucharest Botanical Garden (Romanian: "Grădina Botanică din Bucureşti" 
 
) is a park in the Cotroceni neighbourhood of Bucharest, Romania. It has a surface of 17.5 hectares (including 4,000 m² of greenhouses), and has more than 10,000 species of plants.
The first botanical garden in Bucharest was founded in 1860 near the Medicine Faculty by Carol Davila. Its first director was the botanist Ulrich Hoffmann, followed six years later by Dimitrie Grecescu. The garden was eventually moved to its current location in 1884 by Dimitrie Brândză, a Romanian botanist, and Fuchs, a Belgian landscape architect. The gardens were opened in 1891, when the building of the greenhouses finished. The garden was damaged during World War I, when it was used by the German occupation troops, and during World War II when it was hit by Anglo-American bombardments.
In the Garden there is a Botanical Museum in a building of the Brâncovenesc style, located near the entrance gate, where more than 5,000 plant species are displayed, including 1,000 exotic plants.

Barriers to entry

In economics, barriers to entry (also known as barrier to entry) refers to the things that makes it difficult for a firm or a person to enter a market. These are called obstacles and makes it harder for a firm or a person to enter a market. Examples of barriers to entry include government regulation for firms and the need for a certain level of education for a person.
Barriers to entry helps to protect existing firms in the market from new firms entering a market and thus reduces competition in the market, which causes prices to be higher than what is accepted by society. Monopolies and market power is thus formed due to the existence of barriers to entry.
Definition.
While the general definition of barriers to entry refers to the obstacles that makes it difficult for a firm or a person to enter a market, there are certain differences in the definitions given by economists as given below.

Stromboli is a small island in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the north coast of Sicily. It has one of the three active volcanoes in Italy. 
Stromboli is one of the eight Aeolian Islands, a volcanic arc north of Sicily. The volcano has erupted many times and is constantly active with minor eruptions, often visible from many points on the island and from the surrounding sea. This gave rise to the island's nickname "Lighthouse of the Mediterranean". The most recent major eruption was on 13 April 2009. Stromboli stands 926 m (3,034 ft) above sea level, and over 2,700 m (8,860 ft) on average above the sea floor. 
There are three active craters at the peak. A significant geological feature of the volcano is the "Sciara del Fuoco" (stream of fire), a big horseshoe-shaped depression generated in the last 13,000 years by several collapses on the northwestern side of the cone. Two kilometers to the northeast lies Strombolicchio, the volcanic plug remnant of the original volcano.

Arrondissements of the Aude department

There are 3 arrondissements in the Aude department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.
If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.
Arrondissements are further divided into communes.

Arrondissement of Carcassonne

The arrondissement of Carcassonne is an arrondissement of France. It is part of the Aude "département". Its capital is the city of Carcassonne.
It is the largest "arrondissement" of the department, with an area of 2668.1 km2. It has a population of 161,254 inhabitants and a density of 60.4377647015 /km2 inhabitants/km².
The main cities in the "arrondissement" are Carcassonne (47,068 inhabitants), Castelnaudary (11,748 inhabitants) and Trèbes (5,280 inhabitants).
History.
When the Aude department was created on 17 February 1800, the "arrondissement" of Carcassonne was part of that original department.
Geography.
The "arrondissement" covers the northwestern part of the department and is bordered to the north by the Tarn department (Midi-Pyrénées region), to the northeast by the Hérault department (Languedoc-Roussillon region), to the east by the "arrondissement" of Narbonne, to the south by the Pyrénées-Orientales department (Languedoc-Roussillon region), to the southwest by the "arrondissement" of Limoux, to the west by the Ariège department (Midi-Pyrénées region) and to the northwest by the Haute-Garonne department (Midi-Pyrénées region).
Composition.
Cantons.
After the reorganisation of the cantons in France, cantons are not subdivisions of the "arrondissements" so they could have "communes" that belong to different "arrondissements".
In the "arrondissement" of Carcassonne, there are 7 cantons whose "communes" are in the "arrondissement": Carcassonne-1, Carcassonne-3, Castelnaudary, Montréal, Rieux-Minervois, Trèbes and Villemoustaussou.

Nambu was known for his works to the field of theoretical physics, he was awarded a one-half share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2008 for the discovery in 1960 of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics, related at first to the strong interaction's chiral symmetry and later to the electroweak interaction and Higgs mechanism. 
The other half share was split equally between Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa "for the discovery of the origin of the broken symmetry which predicts the existence of at least three families of quarks in nature."
Nambu became a U.S. citizen in 1970.

Zhenyuanlong

Zhenyuanlong is a genus of dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning, China. It lived in the early Cretaceous period, about 125 million years ago. 
There is just one specimen. It is estimated the skeleton would have been about 165 centimetres (5.41 ft) long when complete. That means the animal was too large to have flown, especially since early flight was, almost certainly, less efficient than the flight of modern birds. It would surely have looked more like a bird than a modern reptile. This is shown in most reconstructions of dinobirds.
This type specimen has a nearly complete skeleton with traces of feathers, including long tail feathers and large wings. This specimen is the first evidence of well-developed feathers in a large, non-flying dromaeosaur. The feathers probably had two functions: temperature control and signalling.

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Ghost nets are fishing nets that have been lost, or that have been been left by fishermen. These nets then float around in the sea, or they end up attached to a rock or other structure. This poses a problem, because the nets continue working. Fish and other animals get caught, and then starve, or die of other causes. Since most nets use plastic, they take a long time to decay. In addition, the nets may release toxic substances while they decay.

Oskar Gröning (sometimes transliterated as Oscar Groening in English; born 10 June 1921) is a German former SS-"Unterscharführer". He was stationed at Auschwitz concentration camp. 
Early life.
Gröning was born on 10 June 1921, in Lower Saxony, the son of a strict conservative and skilled textile worker. His mother died when he was four.
Years at Auschwitz.
His responsibilities included counting and sorting the money taken from prisoners, and he was in charge of the effects prisoners had arrived with. On a few occasions he witnessed the procedures of mass-killing in the camp. Gröning was captured by the British on 10 June 1945.
Upon his return to Germany he led a normal life, reluctant to talk about his time in Auschwitz. However, more than 40 years later, he decided to make his activities at Auschwitz public after learning about Holocaust denial. He has since openly criticised those who deny the events that he witnessed.
Trail.
In September 2014, Gröning was charged by German prosecutors as an accessory to murder, in 300,000 cases, for his role at the Auschwitz concentration camp. His trial began in April 2015, after the court had ruled that, at the age of 93, he was still fit to stand trial. The trial was held in Lüneburg, Germany. On 15 July 2015 he was found guilty of facilitating mass murder and sentenced to four years imprisonment.

Wyatt Earp

Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848 – January 13, 1929) was an American gambler, Deputy Sheriff, and Deputy Town Marshal in Tombstone, Arizona. Earp took part in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaws. 
He is often regarded as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone, but his brother Virgil was Tombstone City Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day. His brother had more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.
Earp lived a restless life. He was at different times in his life a constable, city policeman, county sheriff, Deputy U.S. Sheriff, teamster, buffalo hunter, bouncer, saloon-keeper, gambler, brothel owner, pimp, miner, and boxing referee. 
After an unsettled life as a young man, Earp landed in the cattle boomtown of Wichita, Kansas, where he became a deputy city marshal for one year and developed a solid reputation as a lawman. In 1876, he followed his brother James to Dodge City, Kansas, where he became an assistant city marshal. In winter 1878, he went to Texas to gamble, where he met John Henry "Doc" Holliday, whom Earp said saved his life.
Earp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another. He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved to Tombstone with his brothers James and Virgil, where a silver boom was underway. The Earps bought an interest in the Vizina mine and some water rights. Wyatt, Virgil, and their younger brother Morgan held various law enforcement positions that put them in conflict with Tom and Frank McLaury, and Ike and Billy Clanton, who threatened to kill the Earps. 
The conflict escalated over the next year, culminating on October 26, 1881 in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which the Earps and Holliday killed three of the "Cowboys" (the Clanton/ McLaury group). In the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was assassinated. Pursuing a vendetta, Wyatt, his brother Warren, Holliday, and others formed a federal posse that killed three of the Cowboys whom they thought responsible. Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights, unlike his brothers Virgil and James or Doc Holliday, which only added to his mystique after his death.
After Earp died in 1929, a flattering, largely fictionalized biography was published in 1931. It became a bestseller, and made his reputation as a fearless lawman. Since then, Wyatt Earp has been the subject of and model for numerous films, TV shows, biographies, and works of fiction that have increased his mystique. Earp's modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's "toughest and deadliest gunman of his day". Wyatt Earp has become synonymous with the image of the Western lawman, and is a symbol of American frontier justice.
Two years before his death, Earp defended his decisions before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and his actions afterward in an interview with Stuart Lake, author of the 1931 largely fictionalized biography, "Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal":
For my handling of the situation at Tombstone, I have no regrets. Were it to be done over again, I would do exactly as I did at that time. If the outlaws and their friends and allies imagined that they could intimidate or exterminate the Earps by a process of murder, and then hide behind alibis and the technicalities of the law, they simply missed their guess. I want to call your particular attention again to one fact, which writers of Tombstone incidents and history apparently have overlooked: with the deaths of the McLowerys, the Clantons, Stillwell, Florentino Cruz, Curly Bill, and the rest, organized, politically protected crime and depredations in Cochise County ceased.

<doc id="509428" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=509428" title="Negative temperature">
Negative temperature

In physics, absolute zero (0°K) is one of the coldest temperatures. At that point, subatomic particles stop moving (entropy is at its minimum). Certain things can reach temperatures below absolute zero, known as negative temperatures. This is very difficult to do, and only very small objects can reach negative temperatures.
It might seem absurd, but things at negative temperatures are actually "hotter" than things at positive temperatures (above absolute zero). If something with a negative temperature comes in contact with a positive-temperature object, heat will go from the negative object to the positive. This is because temperature is a trade-off between energy and entropy. If you add energy to a positive-temperature object, it will "increase" in entropy. If you add energy to a negative-temperature object, it will "decrease" in entropy.
Many objects cannot achieve negative temperatures, because adding energy to them will increase their entropy. Only very small things discussed in quantum mechanics can reach this state.

Sterling banknotes are the banknotes in circulation in the United Kingdom and its related territories. They are issued in various denominations of pounds sterling (symbol: £ or GBP).
Sterling banknotes are official currency in the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and Tristan da Cunha. One pound is equivalent to 100 pence. Three British Overseas Territories also have currencies called pounds which are at par with (worth equal to) the pound sterling.
Banknotes are issued by the Bank of England, and also by seven other banks in the United Kingdom. Only the Bank of England notes are legal currency, meaning they "must" be accepted in retail tade, restaurants and so on. 
The other banks, mostly in Scotland and Northern Ireland issue notes which are always accepted in their countries. In London, where many people are of foreign origin, these notes may be refused in some places.

Price elasticity of demand

In economics, the price elasticity of demand (PED or Ed) is a measure to show the responsiveness (or elasticity) of the quantity demanded for a good or service to a change in its price, ceteris paribus. It is also known as the percentage change in quantity demanded for a good or service for a percentage change in the price of the same good or service. In short, the price elasticity of demand is given by the following formula:
formula_1
As the price and the quantity demanded of a good are inversely related (i.e. an increase in price will always cause a decrease in quantity demanded and vice versa), the sign of PED is always negative. Hence, economists tend to just ignore the sign and compare the absolute values instead.
In absolute terms, if the percentage change in the price is more than proportionate than the percentage change in the quantity demanded, the elasticity value is greater than one and the demand for the good is price elastic. Likewise, if the percentage change in the price is less than proportionate than the percentage change in the quantity demanded, the elasticity value is smaller than one and the demand for the good is price elastic.
In diagrams, the price elasticity of demand is shown by the gradient of the demand curve. A steeper curve refers to a more price inelastic demand whereas a gentler curve refers to a more price elastic demand.
Factors affecting price elasticity of demand.
Factors that affect the price elasticity of demand for a good include:

The Pschent was the name of the Double Crown of Ancient Egypt. The Ancient Egyptians called it sekhemti meaning the Two Powerful Ones. The Pschent was made from the Red Deshret Crown of Lower Egypt and the White Hedjet Crown of Upper Egypt. 
The Pschent was a symbol of the pharaoh's power over all Egypt. The design used two animals, a cobra and a vulture. The Egyptian cobra, known as the uraeus, ready to strike, was a symbol for the Lower Egyptian goddess Wadjet. The Egyptian vulture was a symbol for the Upper Egyptian goddess Nekhbet. These were placed on the front of the Pschent and called the "Two Ladies". 
History.
The First Dynasty pharaoh Menes is said to have invented the Pschent. The first pharoah to be shown wearing the Double Crown was Djet, in a rock inscription showing his Horus wearing it. 
The list of kings on the Palermo Stone shows the Lower Egyptian pharaohs wearing the Red Crown. After Egypt is unified, the list shows all First Dynasty and later pharaohs wearing the Pschent. But the Cairo fragment, shows Lower Egyptian rulers wearing the Pschent.
Archaeology.
None of the Egyptian crowns have survived (or been found yet). Like the Deshret and the Hedjet Crowns, the Pschent is known only from statues, paintings, inscriptions, and ancient stories.
Mythology.
Among the gods shown wearing the Double Crown are Horus and Atum. These both represented the pharaoh or had a special relationship to the pharaoh.

Deshret

Deshret was the name for the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. When joined with the Hedjet, the White Crown of Upper Egypt, it forms the Pschent. This double crown was called the "sekhemti" in ancient Egyptian. Deshret was also the name for the desert Red Land on either side of the Nile river.
The Red Crown in Egyptian language hieroglyphs became the vertical letter "n" . The old "n" hieroglyph from the Predynastic Period, and the Old Kingdom was a sign showing ripples in water.
Significance.
In mythology, the earth god Geb, the first ruler of Egypt, gave Horus the power to rule over Lower Egypt. The Egyptian pharaohs, who saw themselves as successors of Horus, wore the deshret to show their authority over Lower Egypt. Other gods wore the "deshret" too, such as the protective serpent goddess Wadjet and the creator-goddess of Sais, Neith, who often is shown wearing the Red Crown.
The Red Crown would later be joined with the White Crown of Upper Egypt to form the Double Crown. This was a symbol to show their rule over the whole country, which they called "The Two Lands".
The Red Land, the deserts and foreign lands around Egypt, was ruled by Seth. The Egyptians saw it as a dangerous confusing place, without laws or any order.
Records of the Red Crown.
None of the red crowns have survived. It is not known how the crown was made or what materials were used. It could have been made from copper, reeds, cloth, or even leather.
The Red Crown is often shown in texts, wall carvings and statues. An early example shows a victorious pharaoh wearing the "deshret" on the Narmer Palette. A text from the reign of Djer records a royal visit to the shrine of the Deshret which may have been at Buto in the Nile delta.
No crown has ever been found buried with any of the pharaohs, even in tombs that have not been robbed. This suggests that the deshret was passed from one king to the next, much as in present day monarchies.

The Hunting of the Snark

The Hunting of the Snark (An Agony in 8 Fits) is a nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll, the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson.
The poem was written from 1874 to 1876. The setting, some creatures, and eight portmanteau words are taken from Carroll's earlier poem "Jabberwocky" in his children's novel "Through the Looking-Glass" (1871). The eight words are: "bandersnatch", "beamish", "frumious", "galumphing", "jubjub", mimsiest (which previously appeared as "mimsy" in "Jabberwocky"), "outgrabe" and "uffish".
The first two stanzas contain one of the most famous quotations in nonsense poetry:
The Bellman refers the mediaeval use of a town crier or bellman. He would ring his bell, and shout "Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!" at set places in a town, and read out proclamations of legal decisions made by courts or the town council. This was necessary because most people were illiterate.
Another curiosity of the poem is that the crew of ten all have occupations beginning with the letter "B".
"What I tell you three times is true": The idea of repetition as a grounds for truth is sometimes called the Bellman's theory. That, of course, is humour. All the same, repetition is a recurring trope in many kinds of discussion and argument.
"The Hunting of the Snark" has been many times adapted for the theatre, and many times referred to in fiction.

Mooselookmeguntic Lake

Mooselookmeguntic Lake is a lake in Maine. It is inside two counties; Franklin and Oxford. It is part of the Androscoggin River watershed. The lake is just a few miles from the Appalachian Trail.
Geography.
Mooselookmeguntic Lake gets water from several rivers. These are the Cupsuptic River, the Rangeley River in Rangeley and the Kennebago River. 
The lake's waters flow out to the southeast, into Upper Richardson Lake. There is a dam between the two lakes. It raises the level of Mooselookmeguntic Lake about 14 feet. When the dam was built, this connected Mooselookmeguntic with Cupsuptic Lake. The two lakes had been separate before. The new lake is used as a reservoir.
Mooselookmeguntic Lake's deepest part is 132 ft. Its surface area is 25.5 sqmi. It is the fourth largest lake in Maine. Mooselookmeguntic Lake is 1,467 feet (447 meters) above sea level.
There are two large islands south of Mooselookmeguntic Lake. These are named "Toothaker Island" and "Students Island".
River name.
The name "Mooselookmeguntic" is really an Abnaki word that means "moose feeding place". 
There is a local story that a Native American was hunting moose in the area, and he saw one. The native had forgotten to load his rifle with ammunition, but shot at the animal anyway. Thinking he had ruined his rifle, he began yelling at the moose about his bad luck. He said: "Moose, look! My gun stick"! This is only a legend but is told often as history. Because of this, another spelling sometimes used is Mooselookmeguntick Lake.
Fishing.
The lake has a good variety of fishes, and is a popular tourist attraction for fishing.

Messerschmitt Bf 110

The Messerschmitt Bf 110 is a twin-engine fighter aircraft. It used two Daimler-Benz DB 600 engines. It was designed as a long-range 3-seat escort fighter in 1935. The first prototype flew on May 12, 1936. The plane was used by the German "Luftwaffe" in the World War II. In Germany it was called "Zerstörer" (the destroyer). Early in the war Germany had great success with the plane until they attacked Great Britain. In the Battle of Britain the Bf 110C was no match for Britain's Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters. The planes designed as escorts (to bombers) had to be escorted themselves. They were slow in turns which was a major flaw in the design. The Hurricane's could out-turn them and the Spitfires could out-run them. After very heavy losses they were withdrawn from the battle. The Bf 110s were reassigned to other duties. One role they were well suited for was as night fighters. Major Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer, Germany's top night fighter ace, claimed 121 victories flying a Bf 110.

Aquanaut

An aquanaut is a person who stays at the bottom of the ocean for 24 hours or longer while exposed to the pressure of the water at that depth in the ocean. This usually happens in a special building, called an underwater habitat, on the ocean bottom.
The first person to stay at the bottom of the ocean for 24 hours was a man from France. His name was Robert Sténuit. This happened in September 1962. The United States Navy had a program in the 1960s called SEALAB in which military aquanauts and scientists spent time on the ocean bottom. This program ended in February 1969 after aquanaut Berry L. Cannon died from breathing too much carbon dioxide.
NASA carries out programs in the Aquarius underwater habitat off Key Largo in Florida. These programs are called "NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations" (NEEMO). The NEEMO programs help teach astronauts how to live and work in outer space.

Police Nationale

In France the Police Nationale (in English language national police) is the state component of public safety. In contrast to the Gendarmerie Nationale personal are all civilian functionnaries of the state. The Police Nationale has several very different sub-directorates, each responsible for specific missions.
In 2014 more than 143 500 peoples were members of the Police Nationale.
Missions of the Police Nationale.
In France the Police Nationale is responsible of many missions.
The first and perhaps the most important is, in French language "sécurité des personnes et des biens". It translation is safety of persons and property. This is the true role of each French police officer.
Like many other police services in the world the Police Nationale has many other missions : counter-terrorism, fight against illegal drug trade, riot operations, and sometime SAR missions on the French beaches and mountains, especially in the Alps.
Organization.
The main directions of the Police Nationale are headquartered in Paris.
The Sécurité Publique.
The Sécurité Publique (in English language Public Security) is responsible of all missions of police on the French territory. For each French department, there is a departmental office. Also for Corsica and overseas departments of France. The majority of police officers conduct their mission in uniform. However, some units have the ability to act in civilian clothes, they are called BAC, for "Brigade Anti-Criminalité".
The Police aux Frontières.
It's the branch of the Police Nationale in charge of the fight against illegal immigration. The Police aux Frontières or PAF (in English language Border Police) is present in all French airports, important railway stations, and harbours. The PAF is also present for the security of the famous Channel Tunnel.
The Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité.
The Compagnie Républicaine de Sécurité, or CRS, is one of the famous direction of the Police Nationale. It's the riot unit. It's also the police directorate in charge of beaches and mountains SAR. Finally, the CRS are involved in the fight against road crime, on French motorways.
The Police Judiciaire.
The Police Judicaire, or PJ, is in charge of criminal investigations. The Police Judiciaire (in English language Judicial Police) tasks range from research of the perpetrators of murders, rapes and robberies in the counter-terrorism. It is also in charge of the scientific police.
The Service de la Protection.
The Service de la Protection, or SDLP, is the service of official bodyguards. The SDLP (or in English language Protection Service) is in charge of security of heads of state of the French Republic.

The RAID.
The RAID (acronym for Recherche, Assistance, Intervention, Dissuasion) is the special unit of the Police Nationale. Made famous in 1993 by a hostage-taking at a school in Neuilly-sur-Seine, it is the elite unit of the Police Nationale. Its members are almost all snipers.
In January 2015 the RAID participated in the hunt for terrorists responsible for the attack against the satirical newspaper "Charlie Hebdo" and the murder of a young policewoman. They led an assault against one of the terrorists holed up in a kosher store in Vincennes, releasing all hostages unharmed.

Cars of the Police Nationale are made by Citroën, Dacia, Ford, Peugeot, and Renault. Motorbikes are BMW and Yamaha.
