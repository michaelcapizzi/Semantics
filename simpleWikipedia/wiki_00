Anzu

Anzu is a genus of oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs from the latest Cretaceous, 66 million years ago (mya). Its remains were found in North and South Dakota. The type species is "Anzu wyliei".
"Anzu wyliei" had a toothless beak, a prominent crest, long arms ending in slender relatively straight claws, long powerful legs with slender toes, and a very long tail. In life, the animal was about 3 m to 3.5 m long and 200 kg to 300 kg in weight. It was one of the largest known oviraptorosaurs and the largest known from North America (though the giant Mongolian oviraptorosaur "Gigantoraptor" was far larger).
The type species is the first well-preserved example of a North American oviraptorosaur. According to a paleontologist at the Smithsonian "for almost a hundred years, the presence of oviraptorosaurs in North America was only known from a few bits of skeleton, and the details of their appearance and biology remained a mystery. With the discovery of "A. wyliei", we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like and how it is related to other dinosaurs". The creature's formidable appearance – "big crests on their skulls, a beak, no teeth, and a very bird-like skeleton" – led to it being jokingly called the "chicken from hell" in press releases.
The fossils of "Anzu wyliei" were found in mudstone rock that had once been part of ancient floodplains. Its Asian counterparts lived in arid or semi-arid conditions. 
Its lifestyle was that of "a fast-running, ecological generalist that didn't quite fit the usual moulds of meat-eating or plant-eating dinosaur". It was not on the direct line of descent of modern birds, but it did have bird-like features: 
The function of "Anzu's" large crest is debated. The crest "is very large and made of paper-thin bone, so it was not able to take much stress. All oviraptosaurs have this crest but it is certainly the largest in "A. wyliei"". The most likely function is for display, signalling to members of its own species. Also, it might be used to attract a mate. 
The fossils showed evidence of injuries, including a healed broken rib and an arthritic toe that was probably the result of a tendon being ripped away from the bone. It is not known whether this indicates that the animals fought each other, or were injured by predators.

Software extension

A software extension is a type of computer program that is meant to "extend" (add on to) what another computer program (called the base program) is able to do. Usually, it has some more instructions that the base program does not have. Either the base program or the extension can tell those instructions to run.

Benign neonatal seizures

Benign neonatal seizures are somewhat rare syndromes (medical problems) which cause "seizures" in newborn infants. A seizure is caused by problems in the electrical activity in the brain. 
One syndrome is "Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures" (BINS) and the other is "Benign familial neonatal seizures" (BFNS). Both syndromes usually happen in infants in the neonatal period, which is the first 28 days after birth. In most cases, the first seizure happens within the first few days after birth. However, some infants may have their first seizure later in the neonatal period, or even months after the neonatal period. The last seizure usually happens while the infant is still in the neonatal period, but seizures may continue after this time.
A third syndrome called "benign familial neonatal-infantile syndrome" (BFNIS). It may cause the first seizure between the second day upwards to 6 months after birth, and usually stops within the first 12 months. 
These syndromes are called ""benign" because they usually cause no long-term harm to the infant, but there is a greater chance of getting seizures later in life. 
In Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures the cause is not known (this is what the word "idiopathic"" means). In Benign familial neonatal seizures and Benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures, there is a "genetic mutation," which means a change in the genes that an infant gets from their parents. These disorders are inherited (they "run in the family"). This is what the word "familial" means.

This is called 'Toast to the Lassies' However, the girls have the last laugh as they do the same to the boys. This is called 'Reply From the Lassies'

Shea Michael Weber (born August 14, 1985) is a Canadian ice hockey defenceman. He currently plays for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL). He serves as their captain.
Career.
Before playing in the NHL, Weber played 3 seasons with the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL). During his time there, he was able to win the Memorial Cup with the Rockets and won the WHL airBC Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Playoffs.
He was drafted with the 49th overall pick by the Nashville Predators in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. On July 8, 2010, he was named the fifth captain in Nashville Predators history, replacing Jason Arnott, who was traded to the New Jersey Devils. He became the youngest captain in Predators history and was the only captain of the Predators to have been drafted by the team.
During the 2012 offseason, the Predators were unable to take Weber to arbitration again (a player can only be subjected to team-elected arbitration once in his career). Weber signed a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million of it as a signing bonus, with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. It was the richest contract in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, which surpassed the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek. The Predators, who had already lost Weber's defensive partner Ryan Suter to unrestricted free agency, were able to match the offer sheet five days later.

Hyman Minsky

Hyman Philip Minsky (September 23, 1919 – October 24, 1996) was an American economist, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis. 
He gave an explanation of financial crises, caused by swings in a potentially fragile financial system. Minsky is sometimes described as a post-Keynesian economist because, like Keynes, he supported some government intervention in financial markets. He opposed some of the financial deregulation policies popular in the 1980s. He supported the Federal Reserve as a "lender of last resort" (which means he thought it right for the Fed to bail out banks which might go bust). He argued against too much private debt in the financial markets.
Financial theory.
Minsky proposed theories were about the normal life cycle of an economy. He linked financial market fragility with speculative investment bubbles in financial markets. Minsky claimed that in prosperous times, when companies make plenty of money, an irrational euphoria develops. Soon debts exceed what borrowers can pay off from their income, which produces a financial crisis. As a result, banks and lenders tighten credit, even to companies that can afford loans. Then the economy contracts.
This slow movement of the financial system from stability to fragility, followed by crisis, is something for which Minsky is best known, and the phrase "Minsky moment" refers to it.
At the University of California, Berkeley seminars attended by Bank of America executives helped him to develop his theories. His views were published in two books, "John Maynard Keynes" (1975), a classic study of the economist and his contributions, and "Stabilizing an Unstable Economy" (1986), and more than a hundred professional articles.

Andrew Vicari (born 20 April 1938) is a Welsh painter working in France. He paints portraits of the rich and famous. Despite being largely unknown in his own country, as of 2004[ [update]] Vicari is Britain's richest living painter.
Vicari has always been a figurative artist working in oil. His work is appreciated especially in the Middle East where three museums are solely dedicated to his work.
In 1974 Vicari was appointed as the official painter to the King and Government of Saudi Arabia. In the years which followed he painted many portraits of the Saudi royal family and scenes of Riyadh and Bedouin life. It is largely due to this patronage that Vicari owes his financial success. In 2001 he sold a collection of 125 paintings of the First Gulf War to Prince Khaled for £17 million.
Vicari currently lives and works at his studio outside Nice, France, although he also owns apartments in Riyadh and Monte Carlo.
His fortune was valued at £92 million in 2006 by the Sunday Times Rich List.

Bucket-wheel excavator

Bucket-wheel excavators (BWEs) are huge machines used for surface mining. 
They are continuous digging machines in large-scale open cast mining operations. What sets BWEs apart from other large-scale mining equipment is their large wheel with a continuous pattern of buckets to scoop material as the wheel turns. 
They are among the largest vehicles ever constructed. The biggest bucket-wheel excavator ever built, Bagger 293, is the largest terrestrial (land) vehicle in human history..
BWEs built since the 1990s, such as the Bagger 293, have reached sizes as large as 96 metres (314.9 feet) tall, 225 metres (738.2 feet) long, and as heavy as 14,200 metric tons (31.3 million lb). The bucket-wheel itself can be over 70 feet in diameter with as many as 20 buckets, each of which can hold over 15 cubic metres of material. BWEs are now capable of operating in extreme climates. Many BWEs have been designed to operate in climates with temperatures as low as -45°C (-49°F).

Spandrel

A spandrel is the space between two arches. It is the space between an arch and a rectangular fence or the space between the right and left exterior curve of an arch and an enclosing right angle.
In structures with more than one floor, the term "spandrel" can also mean the space between the top of the window in one floor and the threshold of the window in the floor above.
Spandrels have different meanings in architecture and art history.
Bridges.
Arches commonly exist in bridge constructions, so spandrels may appear in such structures. Historically, most arch expansions had solid spandrels, meaning that the areas between arches were completely filled in with masonry. This was true until the use of steel and reinforced concrete began in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Domes.
Structures of domes can also contain spandrels. Where domes are needed to rest on a square or a rectangular base, the dome is raised above the level of the supporting pillars with three-dimensional spandrels called pendentives. These triangular segments take the weight of the dome and place it onto the poles.

Luka Magnotta

Luka Rocco Magnotta (born Eric Clinton Kirk Newman; July 24, 1982) is a Canadian pornographic actor and model. He was convicted of murdering and dismembering his male lover Lin Jun, a Chinese international student, then mailing his severed limbs to different political parties and elementary schools.
Magnotta has had schizophrenia since 2000. He was convicted of fraud in Toronto in 2005 and sentenced to community service and probation.
After an 11-minute video titled "1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick" was uploaded to Bestgore.com which allegedly showed the murder was posted online, Magnotta fled Canada and was the subject of a Interpol Red Notice which lead to an international manhunt. Magnotta was arrested after he was found in an Internet café in Berlin while he was reading news about himself. He tried to give police fake names before he admitted who he was. He was handed over to Canadian authorities in Berlin on June 18, 2012 and was flown back to Canada on a Royal Canadian Air Force CC-150 Polaris. Magnotta was placed into solitary confinement at the Rivière-des-Prairies detention centre.
At 11 AM on May 29, 2012, a package which contained a left foot was delivered to the headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada. Another package which contained a left hand was addressed to the Liberal Party but was intercepted in a Canada Post processing facility. A janitor found a decomposing torso in a suitcase. It was left in a garbage pile in the alley behind an apartment building in the Snowdon area of Montreal. On June 5, 2012, a package which contained a right foot was delivered to St. George's School and another package which contained a right hand to False Creek Elementary School in Vancouver.
On June 6, 2012, Lin Jun's family arrived at Trudeau Airport in Montreal. A candlelight vigil was then held in Montreal.
The body parts were later matched to Lin Jun by DNA samples from his family. After police received an anonymous tip, they recovered Lin Jun's head which was lying at the edge of a small lake in Montreal's Angrignon Park.
On July 11, Lin's body was cremated and his ashes were buried in the Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery in Montreal.
Canadian media named Magnotta the Canadian Newsmaker of the Year which caused controversy.
After committal for trial, the preliminary inquiry judge set a tentative trial for September 8, 2014 on April 29, 2013. On 29 September 2014 in court in Quebec, Magnotta admitted killing Jun Lin. He pleaded not guilty to murder due to his schizophrenia. He has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder.
After a twelve-week trial, the jury received their final instructions from the trial judge on December 15, 2014. On their eighth day of the jury's deliberation, they returned a verdict of guilty on all charges. Magnotta is serving a life sentence and he will be eligible for parole in 25 years. Magnotta was also sentenced to 19 years for other charges.
Magnotta was previously sought by animal rights groups for allegedly uploading videos of himself killing kittens.

Agent 47

Agent 47 is a fictional character and the champion of "Hitman (video game series)" franchise. The character was created by the Danish company IO Interactive.
Video games.
There are six video game titles for Agent 47. "They are Hitman: Codename 47 (2000)", "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin (2002)", "Hitman: Contracts (2004)", "Hitman: Blood Money (2006)", "Hitman: Absolution (2012)" and "Hitman 6" which is currently being made by IO Interactive and will be the sixth game of the series.
Appearance.
Agent 47's appearance consisted of a pure black suit, black leather gloves, a white dress shirt and a red tie. Hitman video game series allow the player to engage in stealth mode strategy to avoid direct conflict with the victims. Agent 47 also has the ability to change what he looks like by exchanging different customs which can be stolen from knocked-out, killed victims or from certain places to make the progression easier. The outfits can come from many different NPCs.
Agent 47 has no hair with very white skin and blue eyes. His ICA file from states his height as 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m). In , his weight is given as 187 lbs. Agent 47 has a bar code tattooed on the back of his head which was very prominent in all games except for "Hitman: Absolution" where the bar code was most of the time covered in order for the character to disguise himself after it was known that Agent 47 has this bar code that could get him more notoriety.
His bar code is considered as a security key to access areas of the facility where he was created and trained. Although, in "Hitman: Blood Money" game failed to mention the bar code as a notable characteristic.
Agent 47's facial features are quite imposing, with a long face, large cheekbones, prominent brow, recessed forehead and ice blue eyes. Early in "Hitman: Absolution", 47 tries to remove his iconic bar code with a razor, but it remains visible at the end of the game. 
Character history.
Agent 47 was born on September 5, 1964 in a Romanian asylum with the number 640509-040147 tattooed on the back of his head in the form of a bar code. "64-05-09" refer to his date of birth, "04" indicates Series IV, "01" documents his class and "47" is the order in which he was cloned. According to the Hitman game series and the Hitman novel, Agent 47 is a genetically-enhanced clone and the culmination of decades of secret research into gene augmentation. His creation was funded by five criminal masterminds who donated their own DNA to the project. Aside from The Five Fathers, the maternal DNA was provided by Anghel Comescu. However, his surrogate mother was Teadora Blaga. In "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin", Agent 47 decided to quit killing people for money and lived in a shelter provided by Vittorio, but had to change his mind after Vittorio got kidnapped. Eventually after many missions handled successfully by 47, "Diana" brought the Agency to its knees. She flushed all accounts, cut off all communication lines, exposed the Agency and used the confusion to vanish and 47 puts an end to "Diana" handling a hit on her.
Personality.
Even though 47 is meant to be an emotionless assassin, he shows signs of morality, seen in "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin" confessing his sins (killing people for money) to Father Vittorio. Subsequently, he is so depressed at the apparent loss of his spiritual guide that he agrees to take on the "suicide mission" of killing "Deewana Ji". He is very quiet to the point of being socially awkward which is perhaps the biggest of his very weaknesses. He prefers to stay alone and he has admiration for few people he befriends, especially "Diana" and "Vittorio".
Agent 47 approaches his assassinations with professionalism but will, however show no remorse or regression when it comes to killing or silencing witnesses. Agent 47 speaks in a very formal tone, a tone that shows no threat, rarely swearing or even raising his voice. Given his fees, 47 would have to be a multi-millionare from his contract earnings but never stops going for new contracts. He only spends his money on simple things like food, suits, gear, and shelter, although he is also known to donate some of it to "Father Vittorio".
Skills and abilities.
Agent 47 can take on hard tasks and perform physical tasks more efficiently than any average human. 47 has mastered the art of stealth. He knows how to efficiently and successfully sneak up to a victim and use his assassin fiber wire to eliminate the victim or an injection to poison the victim or knock him/her out. 47 being able to terminate multiple enemies in the same area one at a time and sneak up on almost anybody and quietly neutralize them. Agent 47 also has a lot of knowledge about disguising techniques and ways of accessing unauthorized areas of a location. He is physically strong even when compared to average adult males of his size and build; being able to climb pipes, move and dispose of bodies, snap necks, knock opponents unconscious and jump from a balcony to another balcony, spending a minimum effort. 47 also happen to be a skilled driver and seen piloting helicopters and planes.
Agent 47 has a special level of skill when it comes to using improvised weapons such as explosives, sniper rifles, automatic weapons and bladed weapons. Being able to hold dual pistols firing both of them at the same time whilst hitting the targets. He is a perfect marksman, so well that the newspaper in "Hitman: Blood Money" called him "Legendary Agent 47".

Tailstrike

A tailstrike is when the tail of an airplane hits the runway. This can happen during takeoff or landing. During takeoff, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too early and the plane cannot take off in time. During a landing, a tailstrike can happen if the pilot raises the nose too high during landing.
Tailstrikes usually do not have serious effects, such as killing people. However, this means that the airline has to spend money to repair the plane before it can fly again. If the plane is not repaired correctly, it may cause metal fatigue and in the end, the plane can crash.

The L'Isle-Verte nursing home fire happened on January 23, 2014 at the Résidence du Havre nursing home in the town of L'Isle-Verte, Quebec at approximately 12:35 a.m.
An overnight worker talked to police and told Québecor Média that he was "95% sure" the fire was caused by a cigarette that was lit by a resident who refused to be let outside to smoke less than an hour earlier. He also said that the black smoke that was billowing from above the cracked open door of room 206 on the man's second-floor room. When the worker tried to help, he had "began to suffocate" and needed to leave. On his way out, he was able to rescue a man who had broken his leg by jumping from his balcony. In the fire, an estimated 32 people were killed and 15 people were injured.
Fire safety experts as well as groups such as the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, Ontario Retirement Communities Association, l'Association Québécoise de Défense des Personnes Retraitées et Préretraitées and the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs have called for more strict fire safety measures including required sprinkler installation. As of 2014, 54% of Québec's private homes for the elderly have no sprinklers. The Québec health minister Réjean Hébert suggested that the requirements be more strengthened to put sprinklers into homes for semi-autonomous elderly.

1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot

The 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup Riot was a riot that took place on June 14, 1994 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the first riot in Vancouver since the tour opener for The Rolling Stones which lead to a clash between police officers and 2,000 Stones fans outside the Pacific Coliseum in 1972.
The riot took place after the New York Rangers defeated the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. The riot started on Robson and Thurlow Street after a man fell off of a streetlight into the crowd. When police, who were on bikes, were trying to escort paramedics into the crowd, some members of the crowd tried to take the bikes from the police. Police warned the crowd to clear out and retreated. 
After a while, riot police gathered in the crowd and fired tear gas. This caused the crowd to scatter in different directions. Lots of stores had their windows broken, including 50 windows smashed at a Eaton's store.
The tear gas that was fired drifted into the open windows of residents living on the West End. St. Paul's Hospital responded by putting guards at the emergency room entrance to prevent tear gas victims from entering there. They claimed that there was nothing that could be done for them. After a while, bowls filled with water were put outside by security guards for the people that were suffering from tear gas. The total damage to the downtown core was estimated at $1.1 million CAD.

Operation Yellow Ribbon

Operation Yellow Ribbon was started by Canada to help with the diversion of civilian airline flights because of the September 11 attacks in 2001. It was to make sure that possible destructive air traffic was removed from the United States airspace as quickly as possible, and away from potential U.S. targets. Instead they placed the aircraft on the ground in Canada, mainly at military and civilian airports in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and British Columbia (as well as some in New Brunswick, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec). Canada began the operation after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (carried out by Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids (SCATANA)) had grounded all the aircraft across the United States. The FAA was then able to work with Transport Canada to reroute the incoming international flights to airports in Canada.
The actual number of diverted aircraft and passengers varies from different sources. Transport Canada stated that over 33,000 passengers on 224 flights arrived in Canada, while NAV CANADA stated that there were 239 flights. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said that the number of flights was anywhere between 225 and 250 and that the number of passengers were between 30,000 and 45,000.
On the tenth anniversary of 9/11, President Barack Obama recalled Canada's help during that time, and he expressed his gratitude for Canada's friendship and solidarity.

Cuvier's beaked whale

Cuvier's beaked whale ("Ziphius cavirostris"), is the only member of the genus Ziphius. It is the most widely distributed of all the beaked whales.
It is a record deep diver: 
History of discovery.
The French anatomist Georges Cuvier, in his "Sur les Ossemens fossiles" (1823), first described the species based on an imperfect skull from the Mediterranean coast of France. A peasant had found it on the shore in 1803. 
Cuvier named it "Ziphius cavirostris". The specific name comes from the Latin "cavus" for "hollow" or "concave". This refers to the deep hollow in the skull, a diagnostic trait of the species. Cuvier believed it was an extinct species. In 1850 zoologists realized the species was still living, when Paul Gervais compared the type specimen to a whale stranded at Aresquiès, Hérault. He found the two to be identical.
Prey.
Cuvier's beaked whale feeds on several species of squid. They also prey on deep-sea fish. On March 27 2014 a Cuvier's beaked whale tracked by a satellite-linked tag set a new deep diving record for a sea mammal, plunging nearly two miles below the ocean surface. 
Although it is in the Odontoceti, it has little use for teeth. As adults, two incisors at the front of the lower jaw stick forward. Basically, it sucks in prey by expanding its throat.

Susumu Ohno (大野 乾, Ōno Susumu, February 1, 1928 – January 13, 2000) 
 
 was a Japanese geneticist and evolutionary biologist. He went to the United States in 1951 as a visiting scholar to UCLA. He later became a citizen of the USA.
Biography.
Susumu Ohno was born of Japanese parents in Seoul, Korea, on February 1, 1928. The family returned to Japan after the war in 1945. 
His passion for science came from his lifelong love of horses. He earned a Ph.D. in veterinary science at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in 1949, and later a Ph.D. and D.Sc. from Hokkaido University. 
Scientific contributions.
Ohno suggested that gene duplication plays a major role in evolution in his classic book "Evolution by Gene Duplication" (1970). 
Subsequent research has overwhelmingly confirmed the key role of gene duplication in molecular evolution. Sometimes. one gene copy, or "paralog", takes on a totally new function after a gene duplication event. This means one of the gene copies mutates to develop a function that was not present in the ancestral gene. In this way, a gene duplication may lead to new possibilities in its descendents.
Normally, a big change in gene function is resisted because the original function is needed, but after a duplication one gene carries on the original function. Therefore, a change of function in the second copy is possible without loss of fitness.
In his book, he also suggested that vertebrate genome is the result of one or more entire genome duplications. Variations of this idea have come to be known as the 2R hypothesis (also called "Ohno's hypothesis"). He indicated that mammalian X chromosomes are conserved among species: it has been referred to as Ohno's law. He also invented the term Junk DNA for segments of the DNA that have no known function.

Blue shift

Blue shift is one example of the Doppler effect. It is the opposite effect to redshift.
Doppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. 
The wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.
Doppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion:
The reason astronomers can tell how far the light gets shifted is because certain chemical elements, like the calcium in bones or the oxygen people breathe has a unique fingerprint of light that no other chemical element has. They can see what colors of light are coming from a star, and see what it is made of. Once they know that, they look at the difference between where the fingerprint (called spectral lines) is and where it is supposed to be. When they see that, they can tell how far away the star is, whether it is moving toward us or away from us, and also how fast it is going, since the faster it goes, the farther the distance the spectral lines are from where they should be.

Mycoplasma genitalium

Mycoplasma genitalium is a small parasitic bacterium which lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the primate genital and respiratory tracts.
It has one of the smallest known genomes, and is one of the smallest bacteria. Other very small bacteria are the endosymbiont "Candidatus Carsonella ruddii", and the recently discovered bacterium "Nanoarchaeum". The smallest known free living bacterium is "Pelagibacter ubique" with 1.3 Mb.
Origin and isolation.
"Mycoplasma genitalium" was originally isolated in 1980 from the urethras of two male humans with non-gonococcal urethritis. Infection by "M. genitalium" is fairly common, and is transmitted between partners during unprotected sexual intercourse. It can be treated with antibiotics. Much remains to be discovered about its role in sexual disease.
Genome.
"M. genitalium" has 525 genes. There are 482 protein-encoding genes in a circular chromosome of 582,970 base pairs. An initial study of the "M. genitalium" genome with shotgun sequencing was done by Peterson in 1993. It was then sequenced by Fraser and others. It was found to contain only 470 predicted coding regions, including genes required for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport, and energy metabolism. It was the second complete bacterial genome ever sequenced, after "Haemophilus influenzae".

A puteal is an old-fashioned structure built around the hole of a well. It is made to stop people from easily falling in. Some puteals have bas relief. Some have a step that leads to the water well itself.
Puteals were decoration or part of an architectural design.
In the big places where a lot of people walked in Venice, puteals had cast-iron lids. That protected people even more and stopped the water supply from becoming dirty.
Classically, puteals were made of carved stone, or marble in Europe. They were in big private courtyards and town/city squares.

Basin and Range

Coordinates: 
The Basin and Range Province is a vast geographic region in the west United States and northwest Mexico. Its topography has abrupt changes in height. It has narrow faulted mountain chains and flat arid valleys or basins. There are many ecoregions, but the lower part is mostly desert. 
The physical geography (physiography) of the province was caused by extension and thinning of the lithosphere, which is composed of crust and upper mantle. What caused this thinning is still being investigated. The thinning began around 17 million years ago (mya) in early Miocene time.
The highest point fully within the Province is White Mountain Peak in California, while the lowest point is Badwater Basin in Death Valley. Other high points are at the boundary of the Basin and Range province.
The numerous ranges within the Province in the United States are collectively referred to as the Great Basin Ranges, although many are not actually in the Great Basin. The Basin and Range province should not be confused with the Great Basin, which is a sub-section of the greater Basin and Range region. The Great Basin is defined by its watershed (internal drainage).
Clarence Dutton compared the many narrow mountain ranges of the Basin and Range to an "army of caterpillars marching toward Mexico", which is a helpful way to visualize the overall appearance of the region.

Equation solving

Equation solving is field of mathematics that is about finding the functions or values that will make an equation true. An equation says that two expressions are equal. These expressions contain one or more unknowns, which are usually called free variables. 
There are a number of changes (transformations) that can be done to make it easier to find the solution. There are many kinds of equation, and some have no solution in the domain (field) where they are studied. Other kinds of equation cannot be solved exactly, and approximation needs to be used. Similarly, a system of equations may have no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions.
Methods of solution.

Pseudo-Nero

The Roman emperor Nero committed suicide near the villa of his freedman Phaon in June of 68 AD. Between the autumn of 69 AD and the reign of the emperor Domitian, some people appeared and claimed they were Nero. These impostors were known as Pseudo-Nero. Most scholars believe there were either two or three Nero impostors. St. Augustine wrote of the popularity of the belief that Nero would return in his day, which is known as the Nero Redivivus legend. Suetonius writes that imperial edicts were forged in the name of dead Nero. These edicts encouraged his followers and promised that he would soon return to avenge himself on his enemies.
One of the things that led to the belief that Nero survived was the fact that he died in a location that was not well known. Suetonius wrote that Galba's freedman Icelus saw the dead emperor's body and reported back to his master. Nero was also denied the lavish burial that was accorded to popular emperors and members of the imperial family. This may have left those plebeians who loved him dissatisfied and suspicious. Furthermore, he was not buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus with the other Julio-Claudian emperors, but in a tomb on the Pincian Hill at the family burial place of the Domitii Ahenobarbi. Many Roman plebeians though Nero was very popular after his death, and so they laid flowers at his tomb.
After Nero's death, there were prophecies that predicted he would regain his kingdom in the East. These prophecies possibly inspired people to impersonate him. One version placed his reappearance at Jerusalem. The prophecies have been tied to Nero's natal chart, which has been interpreted as pointing to a loss of his patrimony and its recovery in the East. Tacitus may have been referring to such prophecies in veiled language when he wrote of the rumors that circulated about Nero after his death, which had contributed to the belief that he had survived. The return of Nero may have inspired the author of the Book of Revelation when he wrote about the eschatological opponent called the Beast, which is mortally wounded and then miraculously heals. The number of the Beast, 666 or 616, depending on the manuscript, has been identified by some as the numerical value of the letters in Nero's name. Nero also appears more explicitly in this role in the Ascension of Isaiah and some of the books of the Sibylline Oracles. Because of these prophecies and others, Nero was long thought to be the Antichrist.
Due to the short-lived success of the Nero impostors and Nero's incorporation into eschatological literature, the belief in Nero's imminent return lasted for centuries. Lion Feuchtwanger wrote a historical novel based on the second known Pseudo-Nero, Terentius Maximus, entitled "Der falsche Nero". This novel was published in 1936.
First Impostor.
The first Pseudo-Nero appeared in the autumn of 68 AD or the early winter of 69 AD in the Roman province of Achaia, today modern Greece. Nero had visited Greece (66–67 AD) to participate in its Panhellenic Games, and this may account for some of the support the impostor received. Tacitus attributed the whole phenomenon to the gullibility and restive nature of the Greeks, whom he seems to have disliked. The impostor, according to Tacitus, was either a slave from Pontus, or a freedman from Italy. The historian does not reveal much about the early career of the impostor, except to say that the Pseudo-Nero gathered around him a group of army deserters and then set out to sea.
The impostor's group was blown by storm to the island of Kythnos, one of the lesser islands of the Cyclades, which had only one community worthy of the appellation "polis" in antiquity—the city of Cythnus. Here he supposedly engaged in piracy by waylaying merchants, stealing their cargo, and arming their slaves. Cythnus was long known as a popular base for pirates. The false Nero also made appeals to bring Roman soldiers en route to Italy over to his growing armed force. Nero's successor Galba probably assigned Calpurnius Asprenas with the task of hunting down the impostor on his way to take up the governorship of the province of Galatia and Pamphylia. With information provided by naval captains that the Pseudo-Nero had attempted to seduce to his side, Asprenas ordered his soldiers to storm the ship and kill the impostor. Asprenas then sent the head of the impostor on a tour of Asia and then on to Rome.
Second Impostor.
The second pseudo-Nero appeared during the reign of Titus. He was an Asiatic named Terentius Maximus and also sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero. He gained a great number of followers across the Euphrates to Parthia. He later fled to Parthia and tried to gain their support by claiming that they owed him some requital for the return of Armenia. Artabanus III, the Parthian King, out of anger towards Titus, both received him and made preparations to restore him to Rome. He was executed when his true identity was revealed.
Third Impostor.
The third pseudo-Nero appeared twenty years after Nero's death, during the reign of Domitian. Supported by the Parthians, they hardly could be persuaded to give him up and the matter almost came to war.

American cordillera

The American cordillera is a chain of mountain ranges. It is a sequence of mountain ranges that form the western "backbone" of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica. It is also the backbone of the volcanic arc that forms the eastern half of the Pacific Ring of Fire.
From north to south, this sequence of overlapping and parallel ranges begins with the Alaska Range and the Brooks Range in Alaska and runs through the Yukon into British Columbia. The main belt of the Rocky Mountains along with the parallel Coast Ranges of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and Vancouver Island. In the United States, the cordillera branches to include the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascades and Coast ranges of Washington, Oregon, and California. In Mexico, the cordillera continues through the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental, as well as the backbone mountains of the Baja California peninsula.
The ranges of the Cordillera from Mexico northwards are called the North American cordillera or Western cordillera in the United States and Canada, and the Canadian cordillera or Pacific cordillera in Canada.
The cordillera continues on through the mountain ranges of Central America in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, and becomes the Andes Mountains of South America. The Andes with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of Chile continue through Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile to the very tip of South America at Tierra del Fuego. In addition, the range can possibly be followed through the South Georgia Ridge across the Southern Ocean to the mountains of Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula.

Palace of Caserta

The Palace of Caserta is a palace in Italy. It is just outside Naples. It was built by King Carlo VII of Naples. It was one of the largest buildings built in Italy in the 8th century. It was mainly used as a summer residence of the royal family of the Two Sicilies. In Italian it is known as the Reggia di Caserta. The palace has some 1,200 rooms, including two dozen state apartments, a large library, and a theatre modelled after the Teatro San Carlo of Naples. It is often compared to the Palace of Versailles and therefore called the "Italian Versailles".
In 1997, the palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The nomination described it as "the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space". The king wanted a magnificent new royal court and administrative center for the Kingdom in a place protected from sea attack.

Blazar

A blazar is a very compact quasar (quasi-stellar radio source). They have a presumed supermassive black hole at the center of an active, giant elliptical galaxy. Blazars are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe and are an important topic in astronomy.
Blazars are one of a group of active galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN). An AGN is a region at the centre of a galaxy which has a much higher than normal luminosity over some or all of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
The name "blazar" was originally coined in 1978 by astronomer Edward Spiegel. Blazars are AGN with a relativistic jet which is pointing in the general direction of the Earth. We observe "down" the jet, or nearly so. Many blazars have apparent superluminal features within the first few parsecs of their jets, probably due to relativistic shock fronts.
The blazar at the centre of galaxy M87 is fuelled by a black hole with a mass of about three billion solar masses within ten light years of the galaxy centre.

Unit vector

A unit vector is a vector that, while it still has a magnitude and direction, is only significant in terms of its direction.
Unit vectors are often notated the same way as normal vectors, but with a circumflex (e.g. formula_1 is the versor of a.)
In component form.
Three common unit vectors used in component form are formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4, referring to the unit vectors for the x-, y- and z-axes respectively. They are commonly just notated as i, j and k.
They can be written as the following:

<doc id="444799" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444799" title="BASE jumping">
BASE jumping

BASE jumping is a fringe sport in which a person jumps from a fixed place and uses a parachute to slow down before the ground is reached. "BASE" is an acronym that stands for each of the four jump location categories: from buildings, antennas, spans (bridges) and the earth. This last is similar to "jumping off a cliff". BASE jumping is an extreme sport. This means it involves speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. 
History from skydiving.
The idea for BASE jumping came from skydiving. BASE jumping is much more dangerous than skydiving from aircraft. 
BASE jumps are usually made from much lower altitudes than skydives. Also, the jumper leaps closer to the platform or standing space. BASE jumpers fall through the air at slower speeds than skydivers, because they begin the jump closer to the ground. As a skydiver falls, he accelerates while falling and gains speed with each second. So a BASE jumper does not always reach terminal velocity. Because faster speed while falling through the air gives jumpers more control of their bodies, and a quicker parachute opening, the longer the delay in the air, the safer.
Another danger is that most BASE jumpers have very small areas in which to land. A beginner skydiver, after the parachute opens, may have about three minutes or more of a parachute ride to reach the ground. A BASE jump from 500 feet will only have a parachute ride of 10 to 15 seconds.
Deaths.
BASE jumping has a death rate averaging about one fatality for every sixty jumpers. It is one of the most dangerous sporting activities in the world. It has a fatality and injury rate 43 times higher than parachuting from a plane. 
As of the end of July 2015, at least 264 people have died during a BASE jump.
Dean Potter and Graham Hunt were killed in a BASE jump attempt at Yosemite National Park in California on May 16, 2015. Potter was a well known rock climber. They jumped at dusk from about 3000 feet up. They both quickly smashed into the rocks of the cliff on the way down. Neither jumper used a parachute that might have saved them.
American BASE jumper Ian Flanders died in Kemaliye, Turkey on July 21, 2015. His parachute got tangled in his feet after he jumped and did not open. He fell 900 feet into the Karasu river at a high speed. The jump was being shown live on a local television station.
After the death in Turkey, a fellow jumper said to People Magazine, "There's just this very thin margin of how things can go from 'totally fine' to 'it's over'. And it's really hard to do this sport a lot and have that margin not catch up with you."
In the news.
In September 2013, three men jumped off the incompletely built "One World Trade Center" in New York City. They filmed their jump using cameras on their heads and later showed the video on YouTube. In March 2014, the three jumpers and one helper on the ground were arrested after turning themselves in.

Amoebozoa

The Amoebozoa are a eukaryote phylum of "Amoeba"-like protozoa. Most move by internal cytoplasmic flow. Their finger-like pseudopodia are characteristic. 
They are a major group with about 2,400 described species of amoeboid protists. In most classification schemes, Amoebozoa is ranked as a phylum in either the kingdom Protista or the kingdom Protozoa. In the classification of the International Society of Protistologists, it is kept as an unranked "supergroup" in the Eukaryota. 
Sequence analysis shows Amoebozoa is a monophyletic clade. Most phylogenetic trees identify it as the sister group to Opisthokonta, another major clade which contains both Fungi and Animals as well as some 300 species of unicellular protists. Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta are sometimes grouped together in a high-level taxon, variously named Unikonta, Amorphea, or Opimoda. 
Amoebozoa includes many of the best-known amoeboid organisms, such as "Chaos", "Entamoeba", "Pelomyxa" and the genus "Amoeba" itself. 
Most are unicellular, and are common in soils and aquatic habitats. Some are symbionts of other organisms, including several pathogens. The Amoebozoa also include the Myxozoan slime moulds, multinucleate or multicellular forms which produce spores and are usually visible to the unaided eye.
The nutrition is usually by phagocytosis. The cell surrounds food particles, sealing them into vacuoles where they are digested and absorbed. When food is scarce, most species form cysts, which may be carried by air to other places. In slime moulds, these structures are called spores, and form on stalked structures called fruiting bodies or sporangia.
Most Amoebozoa lack flagella and more generally do not form microtubule-supported structures except during mitosis. However, flagella occur among some archamoebae, and many slime moulds produce biflagellate gametes.
A characteristic form is the model organism "Dictyostelium discoideum".

Duchy of Lorraine

The Duchy of Lorraine was a former monarchy independent from France but situated in mainland France. It was also a State of the Holy Roman Empire. 
The duchy was later given to a dethroned King of Poland and was dissolved in 1766. Historically the members of the family frequently married into other French nobility such as Princesses of the French royal family. The capital of the duchy was Nancy. However, Leopold I of Lorraine later moved the capital to the town of Lunéville. which was a renowned resort in the 18th century, known as the capital of Lorraine. The grand Château de Lunéville, built in 1702 for Leopold, Duke of Lorraine to replace an older palace, was the residence of the duke of Lorraine until the duchy was annexed by France in 1766. The chateau was designed in the style of Versailles to satisfy Leopold's wife, Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the niece of Louis XIV, and became known as the "Versailles of Lorraine". It includes a chapel designed by Germain Boffrand. Leopold and his wife were the parents of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor (through him they were the grandparents of Marie Antoinette).
Important historical buildings.
Apart from the ducal family the "Beauvau" family were very prominent in society holding much influence with the rulers of the duchy due to personal connections. The heads of the family were often titled the Prince of Craon

Parazit was started before the June 2009 presidential elections in Iran. It became very popular in Iran. Many people watched it via illegal satellite dishes and internet. Its name comes from the Iranian government's repeated tries to jam foreign satellite programming. Because it is shown through unofficial channels, it is impossible to say how many people have seen it.

Gibbs free energy

Gibbs free energy is the available energy in a chemical reaction. It was calculated by Josiah Willard Gibbs.
Purpose.
Systems want to achieve as low of a free energy state as possible. The Gibbs free energy number is how far away the current system is from this state. It is analogous to a number line, with zero being the final state. Scientists use Gibbs free energy to determine the energy in a system that can be used. A negative Gibbs number indicates that you can get energy out of the reaction. It is a favorable reaction, which means that the chemical "wants" to move towards its lower state. A positive Gibbs number shows that you must put energy in to get energy out.
An example can be seen in respiration. The Gibbs value of one mole of glucose -686kcal. This means that we can get 686 kcal of energy from one mole of glucose. This means if we put in energy in respiration, we can theoretically get 686 kcal out of the mole of glucose.
Calculation.
The equation for Gibbs free energy is "G(p,T)" = "U" + "pV" − "TS."
This is often simplified as "G(p,T)" = "H" − "TS."
(For the second equation, "U + pV" is replaced by "H" because "H = U + pV)."

Molar concentration

Molar concentration, or molarity, or simply concentration, is a term in physical chemistry. It measures the concentration of a solution or mixture.
In chemistry, the molar concentration, formula_1 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_2 (usually measured in moles – hence the name) divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:
The volume formula_3 in the definition formula_6 refers to the volume of the solution, "not" the volume of the solvent. One litre of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 litre of solvent because when a substance dissolves in a solvent it causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease.
The reciprocal quantity represents the dilution (volume) which can appear in Ostwald's law of dilution.

Basement (geology)

In geology, the terms basement and crystalline basement are used to define the rocks below a sedimentary platform or cover. "The surface beneath which no sedimentary rock is found".
More generally, it is any rock below sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are metamorphic or igneous in origin. In the same way the sediments and/or sedimentary rocks on top of the basement can be called a "cover" or "sedimentary cover".

Platypterygius

Platypterygius ('flat flipper)' is an ichthyosaur of the family Ophthalmosauridae. It was the last surviving ichthyosaur.
Discovery and species.
Fossils are known from Australia, Russia, United States of America, Colombia, Western Europe and possibly New Zealand. There are seven named species. Both adults and juveniles have been unearthed, including newborns and pregnant females. Like other ichthyosaurs, "Platypterygius" gave live birth.
Palaeobiology.
"Platypterygius" reached a length of about 7 m (23 ft). It had a long snout and a powerful finned tail. There are more digits in the front flippers than is usual in ichthyosaurs; they are tightly bound in rows, giving a broad, flat appearance. This unusual characteristic gives the genus its name, meaning 'flat wing.' Furthermore, some of the wrist bones have disappeared entirely. CAT scans on a juvenile specimen strongly suggest that "Platypterygius" was deaf.
Extinction.
"Platypterygius" became extinct during the Upper Cretaceous, about 30 million years before the K/T extinction event. There was an ocean anoxic event at the Cenomanian–Turonian stage boundary. The deeper layers of the seas became anoxic and poisoned by hydrogen sulphide (H2S). As life died off in the lower (benthos) levels of the sea, so did the predators at the top of the food chain. The last pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs became extinct.p251 
No firm reasons can be given for the decline of the ichthyosaurs. By the Cretaceous they certainly had more competitors than in the Triassic, and more elusive prey. The adaptive radiation of teleost fish meant their new prey were fast swimming and highly evasive. The teleosts also included fast-swimming predatory fish, which must have been competitors. This competition, and the ocean anoxic event, must have ended this last remaining line of ichthyosaurs.

Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing

The Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing (also known as the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge and Second Narrows Bridge) is the second bridge that crosses over the Burrard Inlet. It goes from Vancouver to north shore of Burrard Inlet (includes District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver).
It began construction in 1957. On June 17, 1958, when one of the cranes was stretching from the north side of the bridge to join the two chords of the unfinished arch, several of the spans collapsed. This caused 79 workers to fall 30 metres (100 ft) into the water. 18 of them were killed either instantly or shortly after, possibly drowned by their heavy tool belts. When a diver went down to search for the bodies, he drowned and that brought the total of deaths for the collapse to 19. The bridge opened on August 25, 1960 and was renamed the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing in 1994 to honour the workers that had died in the collapse.

Château de Lunéville

The Château de Lunéville was the former royal residence of the ruling Dukes of Lorraine. It is often likened to the far grander and larger Palace of Versailles. It is no longer a royal residence and is today a museum. The restoration of the building and its decors is under way. In France it was referred to as the "Versailles of Lorraine" and is also sometimes referred to as the Palace of Lunéville in English. 
History.
A building had been on the site since medieval times but nothing had been done to improve or update the building due to the poor finances of the Duchy of Lorraine. 
Duke Leopold I of Lorraine was married to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans herself a niece of Louis XIV of France who at the time of their marriage in 1698 was beginning to expand the Palace of Versailles. The ducal family of Lorraine had previously used the Ducal Palace of Nancy itself in the capital of the duchy. The new Duke and duchess had an ever growing family and Leopold took it upon himself to commission another palace reflecting his rank as a sovereign duke. 
Following the death of Leopold of Lorraine in 1729 the duchy was inherited by his son Francis Stephen who eventually married Empress Maria Theresa and he spent most of his time in Austria with his large family.
A after war between France, Poland and Austria apeace was concluded in October 1735 and upheld in the Treaty of Vienna in November 1738. Under its terms, Stanisław Leszczyński, the father-in-law of King Louis XV and the losing claimant to the Polish throne, received Lorraine, while Francis, in compensation for his loss, was made heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which he would inherit in 1737. While the ex king of Poland was in residence the building was known as the "Château Stanislas". Stanisław Leszczyński actually died at the Château in 1766 as did his wife Catherine Opalińska in 1747. After the Polish royals left the Château was largely ignored until it was created a French Historic monument in 1901. It is currently being restored.

Plant breeding

Plant breeding is the art and science of changing the traits of plants to produce desired characteristics. Plant breeding can be done by many different techniques. Plants with desirable characteristics for propagation can be selected. More complex molecular techniques are also possible (see cultigen and cultivar).
Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the beginning of human civilization. It is now done worldwide by gardeners and farmers, or by professional plant breeders employed by government institutions, universities, crop-specific industry associations or research centres.
International development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for preventing famine. New varieties are developed. They are higher-yielding, resistant to pests and diseases, drought-resistant or adapted to different environments and growing conditions.
History.
Plant breeding started with the domestication of the first agricultural plants, a practice dates back 9,000 to 11,000 years. Initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics, and employed these as progenitors for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of valuable traits over time.
Gregor Mendel's experiments with plant hybridization led to his establishing laws of inheritance. Once this work became well known, it formed the basis of the new science of genetics, which stimulated research by many plant scientists dedicated to improving crop production through plant breeding.
Modern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering molecular biology, cytology, systematics, physiology, pathology, entomology, chemistry, and statistics (biometrics). It has also developed its own technology.

Hilbert's tenth problem

Hilbert's tenth problem is a problem in mathematics that is named after David Hilbert who included it in Hilbert's problems as a very significant problem in mathematics. It has to do with finding and algorithm that can solve any Diophantine equations. It has been proved that such an algorithm does not exist.
Overview.
As with all problems included in Hilbert's problems, it was unresolved and considered very difficult when the famous list was published in 1900. The first significant step towards finding the solution was made in 1950 by Julia Robinson, who created a hypothesis (known as the JR hypothesis) around which all later progress revolved. The problem was finally solved with a negative answer in 1970 when Yuri Matiyasevich proved the JR hypothesis. Previous research had shown that this was enough for a negative answer to the problem. The negative answer means that we cannot make an algorithm that can solve any Diophantine equation.

Child of France was a title used by children of the reigning King of France. It entitled the holder of the title to the style of "Royal Highness". However, that was rarely used. The French court preferred to use terms such as "Madame" and "Monsieur". The reigning king, his wife and their children were collectively referred to as the "Famille de France" ("Family of France"). The grandchildren of the king were entitled to the rank of "Grandson or Granddaughter of France". But the more senior of the two titles was that of "Child of France" due to being a child of a monarch. In French a "Child of France" was a "Fils de France".

Seti I

Menmaatre Seti I (or Sethos I as in Greek) was a pharaoh of the New Kingdom 19th Dynasty. He was the son of Ramesses I and Queen Sitre, and the father of Ramesses II. 
As with all dates in Ancient Egypt, the actual dates of his reign are unclear. Various historians claim different dates, with 1294 BC to 1279 BC and 1290 BC to 1279 BC being the most commonly used by scholars today.
The name 'Seti' means "of Set", which indicates that he was consecrated to the god Set (or "Seth"). As with most pharaohs, Seti had several names. Upon his ascension, he took the "prenomen" "mn-m3‘t-r‘ ", usually vocalized as "Menmaatre", in Egyptian, which means "Eternal is the Justice of Re." His better known nomen, or birth name, is transliterated as "sty mry-n-ptḥ" or "Sety Merenptah", meaning "Man of Set, beloved of Ptah". 
The greatest achievement of Seti I's foreign policy was the capture of the Syrian town of Kadesh and neighboring territory of Amurru from the Hittite Empire. Egypt had not held Kadesh since the time of Akhenaten. 
Seti I was successful in defeating a Hittite army that tried to defend the town. He entered the city in triumph together with his son Ramesses II and erected a victory stela at the site. Kadesh, however, soon reverted to Hittite control because the Egyptians did not or could not maintain a permanent military occupation of Kadesh and Amurru which were close to the Hittite homelands. 
The traditional view of Seti I's wars was that he restored the Egyptian empire after it had been lost in the time of Akhenaten. Recent scholarship, however, indicates that the empire was not lost at this time, except for its northern border provinces of Kadesh and Amurru in Syria and Lebanon. 
Seti I has left us an impressive war monument that glorifies his achievement, along with a number of texts, all of which tend to magnify his personal achievements on the battlefield.

Topsham, Maine

Topsham is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. Its population was 8,784 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. Topsham is where the Topsham Fair happens every year.
History.
The Pejepscot Abenaki Indians, a sub-tribe of the Anasagunticooks (now Androscoggins), used to own the land that is now Topsham. They called the this area "Sawacook." The Pejepscot Abenaki controlled the Androscoggin River. They lived and fished at Pejepscot Falls. But a plague, probably smallpox brought by Europeans, killed most of the tribe's population in 1615-1616.
On June 16, 1632, the Plymouth Council gave some land that had once belonged to the Abenaki to Thomas Purchase and George Way. The land was later given to Richard Wharton, and then in 1714 it was given to the Pejepscot Company.
The first sawmill there was built in 1716 on the Cathance River.
In 1717 the area got its current name, Topsham. It is named after the town of Topsham in Devon, England. On January 31, 1764, Topsham was incorporated as a town by the Massachusetts General Court. 
Shipbuilding and lumber mills were important early businesses in Topsham. Pejepscot Falls provided the power to support industry. Lumber mills were very active between 1750 and 1770. Factories later produced things like lumber, watches, doors and pottery.
Topsham and Brunswick were connected with the Underground Railroad during the years of slavery. There were safe houses and underground tunnels to hide escaped slaves in both towns. </ref>http://www.curtislibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/FACTS-AND-LEGENDS-THE-UNDERGROUND-RR.pdf</ref>

Cloisonné

Cloisonné, a French word meaning "enclosed", is a metal-working technique. It is an ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects. The resulting objects can also be called "cloisonné". 
The decoration is formed by first adding compartments or cells to the metal object. This is done by soldering or sticking silver or gold wires or thin strips placed on edge. These are visible in the finished piece, separating the different compartments.
Coloured enamel is the usual filling for the cells. Cloisonné enamel objects are worked on with enamel powder made into a paste, which then is fired in a kiln. In older times inlays of cut gemstones were often used. 
The technique was in ancient times mostly used for jewellery and small fittings for clothes, weapons or similar small objects. They were decorated with geometric or schematic designs, with thick cloison walls. In the Byzantine Empire a technique with thinner wires were developed. This let pictorial images to be made. It was mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and by then always using enamel. By the 14th century this enamel technique had spread to China, where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases. The technique is common in China to the present day. Cloisonné enamel objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century.
The earliest surviving cloisonné pieces are rings in graves from 12th century BC Cyprus, using very thin wire.

Hell Creek Formation

The Hell Creek Formation is a series of rocks where fossil dinosaurs are found. The strata are mostly Upper Cretaceous and some lower Paleocene rocks in North America. 
The name comes from Hell Creek, near Jordan, Montana. The formation includes portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 
It is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited during the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Palaeogene. It was laid down by fluvial activity in river channels and deltas and occasional peaty swamp deposits. All this was along the low-lying eastern continental margin fronting the late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. 
The climate was mild, and the presence of crocodilians suggests a sub-tropical climate, with no prolonged annual cold. The famous iridium-enriched Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary, which separates the Cretaceous from the Cenozoic, occurs as a distinct thin marker bedding above and occasionally within the formation, near its boundary with the overlying Fort Union Formation.
The world's largest collection of Hell Creek fossils is housed and exhibited at the Museum of the Rockies, in Bozeman, Montana. The specimens displayed are the result of the museum's Hell Creek Project, a joint effort between the museum, Montana State University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of North Dakota and the University of North Carolina which began in 1998.
The fossils discovered include all types of late Cretceous dinosaurs, fish, amphibia, mammals (Multituberculates, Metatheria and Eutheria), and other reptiles turtles, crocodylomorphs, squamata (snakes & lizards).

Rolf Harris

Rolf Harris, (born 30 March 1930) is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter, composer, painter, actor, former television personality and former swimmer. He is in prison for sexually assaulting girls.
Early and personal life.
Harris was born in Wembley Park, Perth, Western Australia. His parents were Welsh and emigrated from Cardiff to Australia. Rolf Harris was a student at Perth Modern School from 1943 to 1947 and gained a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Western Australia. He has lived in the United Kingdom since 1953. He lived in Bray, Berkshire, England until he was sent to prison. He has been married to Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes since 1958. They have a daughter, Bindi (born 1964).
Career.
Harris began his television career on the BBC in 1953. He is best known for his art television shows such as "Rolfin bed", "Rolf's Cartoon Club" and "Animal Hospital". In 2005, he painted an official portrait of Queen Elizabeth II in his bed. His best known songs are "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" (1957) and "Jake the Peg" (1965). He also appeared on children's show The Wiggles on their It's a Wiggly Wiggly World! video in 2000 with his song "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport" which was also once a major hit in Australia, the UK and the US.
Crimes.
In 2013, Harris was arrested under Operation Yewtree, which was set up to investigate complaints of sexual assault by television personality and paedophile Jimmy Savile, who died on 29 October 2011. Harris appeared on advertisements for British Paints which is an Australian brand of paint. He no longer appears on these adverts.
Later that year, Harris was charged with twelve counts of having indecent assaulted girls aged 7 to 19 during the 1960s and 1980s. After his computer was seized by police, he was also charged with four counts of making indecent images of a child during 2012. Harris was interviewed and cautioned by police on November 2012. His trial was due to begin in London on 30 April 2014 but was postponed to 6 May 2014. He says he is innocent, denying all wrongdoing. He has also refused to speak to the media and his defence lawyer has said that he will plead not guilty to all of the charges. While awaiting trial on 15 January 2014 when he appeared in a London court with his family, supporters and his security guards, it was decided that Harris would be bailed to stay at his home with his wife until the time when trial starts. He was not allowed to go near anyone under 18 or to contact any of the witnesses. He denied any wrongdoing. Harris' trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 6 May 2014. At the trial it was revealed that Harris was a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character, whose immense talent and public generosity to children and animals hid a darker side - he was sexually attracted to young girls. On 19 June 2014, the jury in the Rolf Harris trial retired to consider its verdict. On 30 June 2014, Harris was found guilty on all 12 counts of indecent assault making him the second person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree after Max Clifford. On 4 July 2014, Harris was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison and is currently incarcerated at HM Prison Wandsworth and later he will be transferred to HM Prison Littlehey. The sentence was later referred to the Attorney General for England and Wales Dominic Grieve after complaints it was too lenient. On 30 July 2014, the new Attorney General, Jeremy Wright, announced that he would not be referring the sentence to the court of appeal for review "as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it. The sentencing judge was bound by the maximum sentence in force at the time of the offending."
Harris was stripped of his BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award after his conviction. Alison Pink (now Steven George since a sex reassignment) who says that he was abused by Jimmy Savile while a woman said that he (then she) once witnessed Rolf Harris visiting Broadmoor Hospital with Savile and they turned up at a woman's ward just as patients were preparing to get undressed in the corridor.
When Harris was convicted his hometown of Bassendean in Perth voted to remove his artwork from their council chambers and to strip him off his status as a Freeman of the town. The Western Australian Department of Education confirmed that Perth Modern School would be removing all artwork by Rolf Harris from display following his criminal conviction.
Harris was taken Bullingdon Prison in Oxfordshire, but was taken later to HM Prison Stafford in Stafford, Staffordshire after he was targeted and spat at by fellow inmates.. 
On 1 August 2014, Harris had applied to appeal against his indecent assault conviction and his lawyers requested permission with the Court of Appeal but on 1 November 2014, Harris lost his first round of permission to appeal.. On 1 December 2014, Harris dropped his bid to appeal the sentence, meaning that he will spend the next 2 and a half years in prison, and the next half will be a non-custodial..
In 2012, he got an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) and on 23 Feberuary 2015, it was rescinded by the Governor-General of Australia.
In 2006, Harris was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). On 4 March 2015, it was taken away by the Queen.

Tenerife airport disaster

The Tenerife airport disaster happened on March 27, 1977, when two Boeing 747s collided on the ground of Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport). This crash killed 583 people onboard the two flights.
The crash was caused by many reasons. One reason is that as the KLM captain wanted to takeoff quickly so that he could return to Amsterdam. This made him that he was cleared by Air Traffic Controller to takeoff and so he began to take off, eventually crashing into the Pan Am flight. At that time, the Tenerife North Airport did not have ground , so the controllers could not know that the KLM flight was taking off.
Another reason was the fog surrounding the airport. The bad weather the , meaning the pilots could not see each other and neither could the controllers see the two planes on the runway. Because of the fog, the pilots only saw each other at the last minute, when they could not have the crash. If there was no fog, the KLM crew would have seen the Pan Am plane on the runway and would not have taken off.
It was the worst crash in the history of aviation.

With their peg-like teeth they could strip leaves from branches, and leave the grinding to gastroliths. They bacteria in their vast stomachs would break down the cellulose in the leaves, and the product would be absorbed further on in the alimentary canal.
The diplodocids have two sub-families:

Key Management Service

KMS (Key Management Service) is one of the methods to activate Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Activation ensures that the software is obtained from and licensed by Microsoft. KMS is used by volume license customers, usually medium to large businesses, schools, and non-profits. Individual computers do not need to contact Microsoft, although the KMS server does. KMS clients must be activated at least once every 180 days. A KMS client will try to activate once every 7 days, and if it fails it will try again every 2 hours. The KMS server can be automatically detected by DNS if the proper DNS record is present, or it can be manually entered using the "slmgr" command. There must be at least 25 KMS-activated computers (5 for Windows Server) on the network to use KMS. If the KMS activation fails (for example, because the KMS server is not available or there are less than 25 computers on the network), a watermark telling the user to activate Windows will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.
Exploits.
There is an unofficial KMS server emulator that will activate Windows or Office even if the software was not licensed or paid for, and regardless of whether or not there are 25 or more computers on the network. There is also a program that will send KMS requests to a legitimate KMS server, in order to fool the server into thinking that there are 25 or more computers on the network. Microsoft considers both of these exploits to be a violation of the Terms and Conditions.

Suicide risk assessment

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
A suicide risk assessment (SRA) is used to figure out how high a person's risk of suicide is. This is a very important first step in helping a person who is thinking of killing themselves, and should be done at first contact with a doctor or other mental health worker. The kind of treatment a person who is thinking of suicide gets at the beginning depends on how high their risk score is. 
The first part of a SRA is talking to a doctor - or other trained mental health worker - who asks different kinds of questions about like what the person is thinking about, how they feel, and what is going on in their life.(This is called a clinical interview). 
The second part of the SRA uses one or more questionnaires. These are written questions that a person answers on their own. Some of these questionnaires have been shown to be very reliable like one called the Columbia-suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS). The SRA is not always right (foolproof), but it still more often than not gives a risk-score that is reliable especially when the Columbia-suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS) is used. The C-SSRS has been used several million times and it has been shown to be very reliable. 
The risk of suicide may changes over time, it may get higher or lower for different reasons. Some of these reasons may be because their treatment is working or things in their life change getting or losing a job, going to a new school, getting a boyfriend or girlfriend or breaking up with one. Because of this the SRA has to be done more than once while the person is in treatment. If the person is in the hospital for treatment it has to be done before they are sent home.
Even though a suicide risk assessment is very important in helping save the life of a suicidal person, they are usually not done. Many mental health care workers have little or no training in how to do a suicide risk assessment. 
If a suicidal person goes for help to a hospital, doctor or therapist and they are getting treatment but kill themselves anyway they can be sued in court  If a suicidal person goes for help to a hospital, doctor or therapist and they are getting treatment but kill themselves anyway they can be sued in court if they did not do a suicide risk assessment. They can be sued for negligible death, which means they did not do their job right and do something they were supposed to do, and because of their negligence (not doing something you are supposed to) someone died; so that's why they need to get this risk assessment; but some times we can not use this to support all of suicide.
Suicide risk after self harm.
Additional information about imminent suicide risk can be obtained when a person has self harmed recently. Good clinical practice might involve the health professional asking about the 24 hour period immediately before the self harm episode (such as events leading to the episode, the degree of planning), the act of self harm (for example, the lethality or dangerousness of the attempt, the patient’s expectations of outcome from the self harm, precautions against discovery, or seeking help), and the person’s mental state at the time of self harm and afterward (such as mood, alcohol or drug consumption). If the same antecedents, mental state, and opportunities for self harm arise, then the risk of suicide or self harm may well be increased.

Oddworld Inhabitants

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Oddworld Inhabitants is the name of a company that publishes games that are set on the Oddworld universe. It was founded in 1994 by Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna. The company has been known for creating the Oddworld Quintology and that is to be finished. It is best known for it's four Oddworld games that were released from 1997 to 2005. The games include: Oddworld Abe's Oddysee, Oddworld Abe's Exoddus, Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee and Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath as well as two Gameboy and one Gameboy Advance games that were short versions of Abe's Oddysee, Abe's Exoddus and Munch's Oddysee. They were titled: Oddworld Adventures, Oddworld Adventures II and Munch's Oddysee. 
In 2005, Oddworld Inhabitants took a break from making video games. They ended up going into film industry and the company were planned to make a plannet like Oddworld called Citizen Siege.
The company are now back into making video games with help from a video game development company called Just Add Water (Developments) UK LTD. They only sell digital products as of 2008 when the original PC games went up on Steam. They also made available the original PS1 games on the Playstation Network store in 2010 for the PS3 and PSP. The classics were made avaliable for PS Vita in August 2012. They started work by porting the original Xbox version of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath to PC. They then made an HD version and had several improvements made to it and it was released in 2011 for the PC and PS3. In 2012 Oddworld announced that Abe's Oddysee was getting a completely re-made game from the ground up and it's title which was chosen by fans is called Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. They also released Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee HD for PS3 in December 2012. 
In 2013, it was announced that New 'n' Tasty will be coming Spring 2014 and at the Game Developers Conference in California, they announced it was coming soon. 
Released titles.
The developers originally stated that the "Oddworld" series would consist of five games referred to as the Quintology. Only two of those five games have been produced, while two additional games from the same universe were developed as expansion titles outside of the Quintology. Production on the Quintology's final three games was halted when the company decided to redirect its efforts toward film production. Those plans, too, were shelved. In 2009, a partnership was created with developers Just Add Water to continue developing the abandoned video games with Oddworld Inhabitants Inc. becoming the publisher of the titles. In order to raise the money to fund the rest of the Quintology, Just Add Water began by porting the studio's first two titles to new consoles and producing high definition remasters of "Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee" and "Stranger's Wrath". A high definition rebuild of "Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee" subtitled "New 'n' Tasty!" was next. Stewart Gilray has confirmed that all five Quintology games are titled Oddworld: X's Oddysee where X is the name of the protagonist.

Rapetosaurus

Rapetosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur. It lived in what is now Madagascar from 70 to 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. Only one species, "Rapetosaurus krausei", has been found. Like other sauropods, "Rapetosaurus" was a quadrupedal herbivore.
The discovery of "Rapetosaurus" was the first time a titanosaur had been recovered with an almost perfectly intact skeleton, complete with skull. It has helped to clarify some difficult issues in this large group of sauropod dinosaurs. It provides a baseline for the reconstruction of other titanosaurs that are known only from partial remains.
By the early part of the Upper Cretaceous all sauropods, except the titanosaurs, were extinct. The titanosaurs were the dominant herbivores of the Upper Cretaceous on the southern continents which made up Gondwana. Their reign was cut short by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
Juvenile.
The specimen discovered was a juvenile. It is 8 metres (26 ft) from head to tail, and "probably weighed about as much as an elephant", according to Kristina Curry Rogers. An adult would have been about twice as long (15 metres (49 ft) in length), which is still less than half the length of its gigantic kin, like "Argentinosaurus" and "Paralititan".

Aularches miliaris

Aularches miliaris is a grasshopper found in south and southeast Asia. It is protected by powerful chemical defences, and its warning colour signals its foul taste.
When it is disturbed or grabbed, it makes a sharp rasping noise with its thoracic segments. Then, if its thorax is pinched, it gives off a toxic foam. It squirts a clear viscous mucus with unpleasant smell and a bitter taste, faintly alkaline, with many bubbles. This foam comes out as a strong jet from openings in the thorax, and more gently from other openings in the body (ten in total). The foam heaps up around the insect and partly covers it.
Colouring and behaviour.
The head and thorax are dark green with a canary-yellow band on the side. The leathery front wings are green with many yellow spots; the legs are blue, with a yellow serrated pattern on the hind legs. The abdomen is black with bright red bands. 
Like most noxious animals, it is very visible and slow-moving on vegetation. It pays to advertise, and it does not need to hide.

They chose the name Airtrek because it was to "describe the vehicle’s ability to transport its passengers on adventure-packed journeys in a 'free-as-a-bird' manner" and was "coined from Air and Trek to express the idea of footloose, adventure-filled motoring pleasure." The new name Outlander was chosen because it suggested a "feeling of journeying to distant, unexplored lands in search of adventure."

Camelops

Camelops is an extinct genus of camel which lived in North America during the Pleistocene. from two million years ago to about 10,000 years ago.
They were prey for the wolves, bears, lions and "Smilodon". "Camelops" disappeared at the end of the last ice age, as did many other animals.
Changes in their environment.
Evidence of its environment comes from Natural Trap Cave in Wyoming, and from Rancho La Brea in the modern Los Angeles area. These studies suggest that it was not, like modern camels, adapted to desert conditions. It lived in woodland and grasslands with mixed vegetation.
Before the climate change at about 11,000 years ago it lived in "conifer parklands" on the Montana-Wyoming border, and in "coastel shrublands" in California. After the climate change, what had been woodland became "deserts and treeless steppes of the sort so extensive in the present western U.S.A". Even the type of grass which grew there changed.
Evidently, for this animal, the climate change was very significant. Also, the arrival of man as a hunter may have made the situation worse. A few Clovis points have been found in the cave site.

Steppe wisent

The steppe bison, or steppe wisent ("Bison priscus"), is an extinct bison. It lived on steppes in Europe, Central Asia, Beringia, and North America during the Quaternary. It is believed that it evolved somewhere in South Asia, That would mean it appeared at about the same time and region as the aurochs, with which its descendants are sometimes confused.
The steppe wisent became extinct in the Pleistocene. It was replaced in Europe by the modern wisent species. It was replaced in America by "Bison latifrons", then later "Bison antiquus"), and finally the modern American bison.
Steppe wisent occasionally appear in cave painting. They are in the famous Cave of Altamira and Lascaux. They have also been found in naturally ice-preserved form.

The Pinwheel galaxy (Messier 101, M101 or NGC 5457) is a face-on spiral galaxy in the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear.
The galaxy is 21 million light-years (six megaparsecs) away from us. It was first discovered by Pierre Méchain on 27 March 1781. Charles Messier verified its position and included it in the "Messier Catalogue" as one of the last entries.
In 2006, NASA and the ESA released a very detailed image of the Pinwheel Galaxy, which was the largest and most detailed image of a galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope at the time. The image was composed from 51 individual exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos.
Interesting features.
On 24 August 2011, a Type Ia supernova, SN 2011fe, was discovered in M101.
A remarkable property of this galaxy is its huge and extremely bright H II regions, of which about 3,000 can be seen on photographs. H II regions have numbers of short-lived blue stars formed from clouds of high density molecular hydrogen. These regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light that ionizes the surrounding gas. 
The galaxy contains ULX-1 (an ultra-luminous X-ray source), which is a relatively small black hole, just 20 to 30 times the mass of our Sun.

Bittern

Bitterns are waterbirds, living mostly in freshwater sites. They are a type of heron, wading birds in the family Ardeidae. They are shorter-necked, and more secretive than other herons. Most of them have good camouflage amongst the reeds where they make their nests.
Bitterns form a monophyletic subfamily of the herons, the Botaurinae.
Bitterns usually frequent reedbeds and similar marshy areas, and feed on amphibians, reptiles, insects, and fish. Unlike the similar storks, ibises, and spoonbills, herons and bitterns fly with their necks retracted, not outstretched.
They were called "hæferblæte" in Old English; the word "bittern" came to English from Old French. 
Bitterns are in three genera. The genus "Ixobrychus" contains mainly small species. The genus "Botaurus" has the larger bitterns. There is a single species in a third genus, "Zebrilus". The distribution of bitterns is pretty much worldwide.

Behavioral economics

Behavioral economics is a smaller part of economics that combines what we know about psychology with what we know about economics. Normally, economics does not consider the way humans actually think, but instead, simplifies decision-making to make economic models easier to understand. However, this is not a complete picture of how the world, and economics, really works. Normally, economists assume people are rational, meaning they make good decisions at the right times using all information. In real life, people do not do this. They are subject to problems with self-control, problems with time, and make different choices depending on how decisions are presented to them. Behavioral economists look at the world given problems and limitations that result when real humans are faced with decisions. 
History.
The study of behavioral economics really began to develop in the middle and towards the end of the 20th century. Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman wrote a paper called “Prospect Theory,” which was about how the way choices are presented to somebody is just as important as the choices themselves when an individual is making a decision. Later, Hersh Shefrin and Richard Thaler created a savings model which explains how people do not figure out how much to save and spend to stay at a constant level. People would rather spend more now, because humans prefer gratification in the near future. By 1994, Harvard University hired a professor to teach behavioral economics as its own subject. Now, behavioral economics helps explain many complex things that people do. There are many applications of the research, such as how to make public policy more effective or marketing and advertising applications. Also, there are other areas of study branching off from behavioral economics, like behavioral finance, which deals with how people make investments. 
Topics.
Behavioral economics can explain many different kinds of human actions. Some of the topics within the field are:
Loss aversion/Prospect Theory: People are made more upset by losses than they are made happy by gains of the same amount. This is important for how people think about taking risks. Related is the disposition effect, which is closely related to behavioral finance. The disposition effect is the tendency for investors to hold onto losing stocks too long, and sell winning ones too soon. This concept relates to loss aversion, since the investors are putting off making their losses a reality. Also related is the behavioral economic concept of “status quo bias.” This explains that, against what economics would expect, people seem to like their current state more than any other state they see as different. 
Mental Accounting: People have separate mental accounts when it comes to spending and saving. Each mental account has a different degree of willingness to spend connected to it, and people assign activities to mental accounts 
Anchoring/ Status Quo Bias: When given an option automatically, people tend to want to stay with that choice, whether or not that choice is what should be best for them. 
Unbounded Selfishness: People are mostly driven by self-interest, and will act in a way which produces the best outcome for themselves. 
Unbounded Willpower: Individuals lack self control. Even when they know what is in their best interest, they tend to act otherwise. People are also somewhat aware of their limited willpower. 
Applications.
Now that behavioral economics is growing in popularity, and more social scientists are researching the topic, ways to apply ideas are becoming more common. If framing a choice a certain way will “nudge,” or push, someone to make a better decision, those who are in charge of creating options can use this to produce a better outcome. These outcomes can range from increasing physical activity to decreasing obesity and changing eating habits, to lessening energy use or to reshaping government policies. In the future, the hope is that through small changes, the public will receive large-scale benefits. In Denmark, the Danish government is employing the concept of anchoring to increase the amount of drivers who are organ donors. In the United States, the White House has hired Cass Sunstein, a behavioral economist, to help guide policymakers. Richard Thaler also works in the US Cabinet on the new Behavioral Insight Team. The U.S., as well as Britain, has considered the idea of default options helping increase retirement savings. 
Problems.
One of the biggest arguments economists have against behavioral economics is that much of its research comes from small-scale research data, instead of real world sources. In addition, a lot of behavioral economic researchers use college students in their studies. College students have less experience than normal individuals. Since this population is a poor representation of an average person, data might show different results than it should. 
Some psychologists argue that while behavioral economics is a step in the right direction in explaining why people act they way that they do, it is still far behind in research. They feel that it just changed traditional neoclassical economic theory, when they need to look deeper as to what is actually going on a more psychological and intellectual level.

Palaeoclimatology

Palaeoclimatology (or palaeoclimatology) is the study of changes in climate over the entire history of Earth. Modern interest in climate change has caused a great increase in the climates of the past.
The climates of the past can only be studied by proxy. Data is got from rocks, sediments, ice and tree rings, corals, shells and microfossils. These records are used to work out the past states of the Earth's climate and its atmospheric system.
Studies of past changes in the life and ecosystems of the past may throw a light on the present. An example is the effect of climate on mass extinctions and the recovery of life after those extinctions.

The Aragón river has a length of 190 km and a drainage basin with an area, including the area of the Arga river, of 8609 km2; without the Arga river, its chief tributary, the area is 5850 km2.
The areas of the different parts of the watershed of the Aragón River are:
Course.
The source of the Aragón river is in the Astún Valley, in the Pyrenees, in the Huesca province (Aragon) next to the border with France, at an altitude of 2050 m.
It leaves the high mountains and flows to the south through the Canfranc valley and then turns to the west in Jaca. In Jaca, its discharge is 8.15 m3/s but it is increased by some tributaries as Gas, Lubierre, Candanchú, Estarrún, Aragón Subordán, Aragón Veral and Esca. When the river gets into Yesa, where is the Yesa dam, the discharge is 38 m3/s.
Below the dam, the Aragón river flows to the southwest into Navarre, and finally flows into the Ebro river at Milagro, where the discharge is 140 m3/s.
The main tributaries of the Aragón river are in Navarre; these are Iratí, Cidacos and Arga.

Sesame Workshop

Sesame Workshop is a company established in 1968. It was called Children's Television Workshop (CTW) until 2000. The Workshop is an American non-profit organization for the research and production of educational children's programs.
The Workshop oversaw the production of "Sesame Street", a television show for pre-school children from low-income families. Two years were spent, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new show. It was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".
"Sesame Street" premiered on PBS in the United States in November 1969. 
Co-founder Joan Ganz Cooney said of the CTW model: "From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners". She described the collaboration as an "arranged marriage".
Research.
Cooney's proposal included using "in-house formative research". This would inform and improve production. Independent evaluations tested the show's impact on its young viewers' learning.
Gerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to do research for the show. Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying children and television at the time.144 They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the "CTW model".
Later.
After "Sesame Street"'s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival. Their funding sources were organizations that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981. 
The CTW expanded into other areas, including the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and outreach programs to preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million. By 2008, the "Sesame Street" Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees.

Megaflood

A megaflood is a flood which suddenly releases a huge amount of water. In geomorphology it is sometimes called an outburst flood. At the end of the last ice age, many large floods were caused by the collapse of ice sheets or glaciers which formed the dams of glacial lakes. 
Examples of older outburst floods are known from the geological past of the Earth. Landslides, lahars, and volcanic dams can block rivers and create lakes. When the rock or earth barrier collapses, or is eroded, this triggers floods. Lakes also form behind glacial moraines, which can collapse and create outburst floods.
Examples.
The Black Sea (~7,600 years ago).
It is claimed that a rising sea flood led to refilling of the freshwater glacial Black Sea with water from the Aegean. It is described as "a violent rush of salt water into a depressed fresh-water lake in a single catastrophe that has been the inspiration for the flood mythology". 
The marine incursion was caused by the rising level of the Mediterranean about 7,600 years ago. It is the subject of debate among geologists. The existence of the flood is not certain, and the theory that it was the basis for later flood myths is not proven.
The Caspian and Black Seas (around 16,000 years ago).
A theory proposed by Andrey Tchepalyga of the Russian Academy of Sciences dates the flooding of the Black Sea basin to an earlier time and from a different cause. According to Tchepalyga, global warming beginning from about 16,000 years ago caused the melting of the Scandinavian ice sheet. This caused a massive river discharge which flowed into the Caspian Sea. The Caspian basin could not contain all the floodwater, which flowed into the ancient Black Sea basin. This would have flooded large areas that were previously settled or used for hunting. Tchepalyga suggests this may have formed the basis for legends of the great Deluge.
English Channel floods.
Originally there was an isthmus across the Strait of Dover. During an earlier glacial maximum, the exit from the North Sea was blocked to the north by an ice dam, and the water flowing out of rivers backed up into a vast lake on the bed of what is now the North Sea. A gently upfolding chalk ridge linked the Weald of Kent and Artois, perhaps some 30 metres (100 feet) higher than the current sea level. 
At some time, probably around 425,000 years ago, and again around 225,000 years later, the barrier failed.
This let loose a catastrophic flood which diverted the Rhine into the English Channel and separated Britain from the continent of Europe. A sonar study of the sea bed of the English Channel showed unmistakable signs of a megaflood on the English Channel seabed.
Refilling the Mediterranean (5.3 million years ago).
A catastrophic flood refilled the Mediterranean Sea 5.3 million years ago. The flood occurred when Atlantic waters found their way through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean basin, which was then a salt lake and salt bed.
Glacial lake floods in North America.
In North America during glacial maximum, there were no Great Lakes as we know them. but "proglacial" (ice-frontage) lakes formed and shifted. The most famous of these proglacial lakes was Lake Agassiz. Melting ice caused a series of great floods from Lake Agassiz. Massive amounts of freshwater was added to the world's oceans.
The last of the North American proglacial lakes, north of the present Great Lakes, reached its largest volume around 8,500 years ago, when joined with Lake Agassiz. But its outlet was blocked by the great wall of the glaciers and it drained by tributaries, into the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers far to the south. About 8,300 to 7,700 years ago, the ice-dam failed catastrophically. Lake Ojibway's beach terraces show that it was 250 m above sea level. The volume of Lake Ojibway is estimated to have been about 163,000 cubic kilometres, more than enough water to cover a flattened-out Antarctica with a sheet of water 10 m deep. That volume was added to the world's oceans in a matter of months.
The detailed timing and rates of change after the onset of melting of the great ice-sheets are subjects of continuing study.
Overflow of lakes formed by landslides.
A landslide dam on Sichuan's Dadu River burst and caused a flood on 10 June 1786. The flood extended 1400 km downstream and killed 100,000 people. This was one of the worst landslide-related disasters in history.

Caledonian orogeny

The Caledonian orogeny was a mountain building era which left its mark in the northern parts of the British Isles, the Scandinavian Mountains, Svalbard, eastern Greenland and parts of north-central Europe.
The events occurred from the Ordovician to early Devonian, roughly 490–390 million years ago (mya). It was caused by the closure of the Iapetus Ocean when the continents and lands of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia collided.
The Caledonian orogeny is named after Caledonia, the Latin name for Scotland. The name is not used for an absolute period of time: it applies only to the series of mountain-building events.
Part of the mountain chain ended up in modern North America, where it is called the Acadian orogeny.
Stages.
The Caledonian orogeny was one of several orogenies that would eventually form the supercontinent Pangaea later in the Palaeozoic era. The main phase of the Caledonian orogeny happened from about 425 to 395 million years ago.
Continental collision started in the mid Silurian, and mountain building took place in the early Devonian (from 407 million years ago onward).

Following is a 1998 British drama thriller movie directed by Christopher Nolan. It stars Jeremy Theobald, Alex Haw, Lucy Russell, and John Nolan. It was released on September 12, 1998. This was Christopher Nolan's first movie. It tells the story of a young man who follows strangers around the streets of London and is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance.
As Christopher Nolan's debut feature, it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make: scenes were heavily rehearsed so that just one or two takes were needed, thus economising on 16 mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was paying from his salary. Without expensive professional lighting equipment, Nolan mostly used available light. Apart from writing, directing, and photographing the film, Nolan also helped in editing and production.Instead of fighting against the limitations of the production, Christopher Nolan allowed them to dictate everything from the film’s structure, to its handheld shooting style, to the 16mm film it was shot on.. to black-and-white stock and setting the scene during the day and place the characters next to windows or in natural sunlight as much as possible. Nolan has explained it in a detailed interview with VICE.

The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s (commonly dubbed the S&L crisis) was the failure of 1,043 out of the 3,234 savings and loan associations in the United States. It lasted from 1986 to 1995. In 1996, the General Accounting Office estimated the total cost to be $160 billion, including $132.1 billion taken from taxpayers. 
The man behind the crisis was Charles Keating. He was sentenced for his involvement of the crisis. Some people blame Ronald Reagan for the crisis because he signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which some might think was a direct result of the crisis.

Lewis &amp; Clark College

Lewis & Clark College is a private university in Portland, Oregon. The school was formed in 1867, and has about 3,600 students, and about 150 teachers. 
History.
The college started in 1867 in Albany, Oregon as part of the Presbyterian Church. At that time is was called Albany Collegiate Institute. The first class graduated in 1873. In 1905 the school changed its name to Albany College and started giving Bachelor of Arts degrees. The school opened a campus in Portland in 1934. The Portland campus was very popular, so the school decided to move there. The school opened a much larger campus in Portland in 1942, and renamed the school Lewis & Clark College, to honor the Lewis and Clark Expedition. In 1966, the school stopped being part of a church and became a secular school.
Students.
In 2013 Lewis & Clark College had 2,039 undergraduate students and 1,553 graduate students. The school has 29 majors. The most popular major is Social Science. 64% of students who apply to the school are accepted. In 2013 tuition was $41,928 a year. 60% of students are female, and 40% of students are male. The school does not have any fraternities or sororities.

Harry Brearley

Harry Brearley (18 February 1871 – 14 July 1948) was an English metallurgist who invented stainless steel, that is, steel which does not rust.
Life.
Brearley was born in Sheffield, England, the son of a steelworker and his wife. He left Woodside School at the age of twelve to enter as a labourer in his father's steelworks. Later he got the post of general assistant in the company's chemical laboratory.
For several years, in addition to his laboratory work, he studied to specialize in steel production techniques and related chemical analysis methods.
In 1908, two of Sheffield's principal steelmaking companies agreed to jointly finance a common research laboratory (Brown Firth Laboratories). Harry Brearley was asked to lead the project.
After leaving Brown Firth, Brearley joined Brown Bayley's Steel Works, also in Sheffield. He became a director of the firm in 1925.
In 1941 Brearley created a charitable trust The Freshgate Trust Foundation, a grantmaking charity operating in Sheffield and South Yorkshire.
Stainless steel.
In the troubled years immediately before World War I, arms manufacturing increased greatly in the UK. There were problems due to erosion (excessive wear) of the internal surfaces of gun barrels. Brearley began to research new steels which could better resist the erosion caused by high temperatures. He began to add chromium to steel, which was known to raise the material’s melting point, as compared to the standard carbon steels.
The research concentrated on quantifying the effects of varying the levels of carbon (C, at concentrations around 0.2 weight %) and chromium (Cr, in the range of 6 to 15 weight %).
The discovery.
In order to do examine the alloys, a metal sample is treated. For a carbon steel, a dilute solution of nitric acid in alcohol is sufficient to produce the required effect. Brearley found that the new chromium steels were very resistant to chemical attack.
Up to that time carbon-steel knives rusted if they were not polished. Only expensive sterling silver or EPNS cutlery avoided the problem. With this in mind, Brearley tested his chromiun steel with food acids such as vinegar and lemon juice. The results were very promising. 
At first, Brearley called the new alloy "rustless steel". The better-sounding "stainless steel" was suggested by Ernest Stuart, a local cutlery manufacturer. 
The first true stainless steel, a 0.24wt% C, 12.8wt% Cr ferrous alloy, was produced by Brearley in an electric furnace on 13 August 1913. He was subsequently awarded the Iron and Steel Institute's Bessemer Gold Medal in 1920. The American Society for Metals gives the date for Brearley's creation of casting number 1008 (12.8% chromium, 0.44% manganese, 0.2% silicon, 0.24% carbon and 85.32% iron) as 20 August 1913.
Almost all research projects into stainless steels were interrupted by the 1914–18 War. The work was taken up again in the 1920s. Brearley had left the Brown Firth Laboratories in 1915, but the research continued under the direction of his successor, Dr. W. H. Hatfield. It is Hatfield who is credited with the development, in 1924, of a stainless steel which even today is probably the widest-used alloy of this type, the so-called "18/8", which in addition to chromium, includes nickel (Ni) in its composition (18wt% Cr, 8wt% Ni).

California Über Alles

"California Über Alles" is the first single off American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys' debut studio album "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables". The song was released in June 1979. 
The lyrics for the song were written by lead singer Jello Biafra and John Greenway for their band, The Healers. Biafra composed the music during one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.
The song is about Jerry Brown, the Governor of California from 1975-1983 (and later 2011–present). It is sung from his perspective, as a fictional version of Brown shapes a hippie-fascist vision for America. The title is a reference to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany, which began with the words "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles" (literally: "Germany, Germany above all").
The song appeared in the video games Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and the Rock Band series.

Bryan Wallace Berard (born March 5, 1977) is a American retired professional ice hockey defenceman. Berard played a total of 619 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Columbus Blue Jackets, Chicago Blackhawks, Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and New York Islanders.
Career.
Before playing in the NHL, Berard played 1 season with the Detroit Junior Red Wings and 1 seasons with the Detroit Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He was drafted with the 1st overall pick by the Ottawa Senators in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft.
Berard is best known for a game he played on March 11, 2000 where he was clipped in the right eye by Senators' Marian Hossa and had his sclera slashed. This resulted in both a retinal tear and a detached retina. Berard was told that he might have to lose his eye. During the next season, Berard had over 7 eye operations. The operations left him with 20/600 in his damaged eye. He would later be fitted with a contact lens which allowed him to meet the league's minimum vision requirement of 20/400. He was awarded the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for his ability to "overcome an injury that left him legally blind in one eye" in 2004.
In early 2006, it was announced that Berard had tested positive for an anabolic steroid which was known as 19-Norandrosterone, in a drug test that he took in November 2005. Berard became the first NHL player to ever test positive for steroids. He said in a statement: "I made a mistake that resulted in a suspension and, while unintentional, I take full responsibility. I became aware of this problem after the fact, and for that I am disappointed in myself." He retired from playing professional ice hockey in 2009.
Later life.
On November 13, 2013, Berard along with ex-police officer John Kaiser, helped catch two con artists that were conspiring to steal $15 million from NHL players as well as many Long Island police officers and their families.

Ground beetle

Ground beetles are the Carabidae, a large, cosmopolitan family of beetles. There are more than 40,000 species worldwide, about 2,000 of which are found in North America and 2,700 in Europe. There are a large number of subfaamilies.
Description.
Although their body shapes and colouring vary, most are shiny black or metallic. They have ridged wing covers (elytra). The elytra are fused in some large flightless species.
Almost all carabids have a groove on their foreleg with a comb of hairs used to clean their antennae.
Defensive secretions.
They defend themselves with noxious secretions. This is typical for the ancient beetle suborder Adephaga to which they belong. They have paired glands in the lower back of the abdomen. These are well developed, and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators. 
In bombardier beetles these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion with a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas. This can injure small mammals, such as shrews, and may kill invertebrate predators outright. To humans, getting "bombed" by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has evolved twice – in the flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) which are among the most ancient ground beetles, as well as in the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae) which are part of a more "modern" lineage. 
The Anthiini can squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in Afrikaans they are known as "oogpisters 
 
" ("eye-pissers"). Charles Darwin got on the receiving end of a bombardier beetle's defences on a collecting trip in 1828. He discussed this in a letter:
"A "Cychrus rostratus" once squirted into my eye & gave me extreme pain; & I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) & caught one in each hand, when lo & behold I saw a sacred "Panagaeus cruxmajor"; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, & to lose "Panagæus" was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust & pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat & I lost both Carabi & "Panagæus"!" 
Ecology.
Ground beetles often live under the bark of trees, under logs, or among rocks or sand by the edge of ponds and rivers. Most species are carnivorous and actively hunt for any invertebrate prey they can overpower. Some run fast to catch their prey; tiger beetles (Cicindelinae) are certainly fast runners in comparison to their length. Unlike most Carabidae, which are nocturnal, the tiger beetles are active daytime hunters and often brightly coloured. They have large eyes and hunt by sight. Ground beetles of the species "Promecognathus laevissimus" are specialised predators of the cyanide millipede "Harpaphe haydeniana". They can counter the hydrogen cyanide which makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores.

Punch-Out!! (Wii)

Punch-Out!! is a boxing video game written by Next Level Games for the Nintendo Wii. It is the fifth game in the "Punch-Out!!" series.
It was first sold at the Nintendo World Store in New York City on May 16, 2009. It was then in other shops from May 18, 2009 in North America, and from May 22, 2009 in Europe.
In January 2015 Nintendo Direct, said that "Punch-Out!!" and other Wii games would be released for download through the Wii U's Nintendo eShop.
Play.
"Punch-Out!!" stars a boxer named Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful boxers. The game requires good speed to keep up with the boxers who are controlled by the Wii. Some of the new opponents in this game are Disco Kid, Giga Mac and Donkey Kong. There are also ten boxers from old versions of "Punch-Out!!". 
The Wii Remote and Nunchuk can be used together, a Wii Balance Board can be used along with Wii Remote and Nunchuk to duck or dodge, or the Wii Remote can be used by itself.
The player must react quickly and spot the moves the opponent is about to make. They need to dodge or block their attacks, before returning with attacks to either the body or the head with the left and right fists. Hitting a weak point at the right time earns stars, with the player able to save up to three stars, losing them if they are hit. When the player has one or more stars, they can perform a Star Punch which deals extra damage. Each fighter has a gauge which must be run down in order to knock the opponent down. Also the player has a heart counter that goes down if they are hit, or if their attacks are blocked. If it reaches zero, the player cannot attack. The player wins a match by either knocking out their opponent (either by a ten count or because they are unable to recover), earning a "technical knock out" by knocking them down three times in a single round, or winning by decision after three rounds have passed. If the player is hit by a knockout punch, it is possible to recover.
Development.
The game was revealed in 2008 at the Nintendo Media Summit, where a fifteen second trailer was shown. It was later announced that it was being developed by Next Level Games which had worked with Nintendo on games such as "Super Mario Strikers". Nintendo wished to make a new game similar to the original "Punch-Out!!" for the NES, so they asked the studio to design the game to be exactly like it and the characters to look like the original games.

Reagan Era

The Reagan Era or Age of Reagan is a era in American history that lasted from 1981 to 1989. It is used by historians and political theorist to show that the conservative "Reagan Revolution" led by President Ronald Reagan in domestic and foreign policy had a long and lasting impact. 
During the era.
Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980. He defeated incumbent Jimmy Carter by winning 44 out of the 50 American states. During the Reagan Era, the country was facing through inflation, a bad economy, and the American foreign policy were not as good. When Ronald Reagan became president, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 which helped the economy. Afterwards more and more jobs began to appear. More people were getting jobs. The inflation decreased. During Reagan's presidency, he also helped expand the American military. This also created more jobs, but also raised the deficit. During his first term, the economy went from a 4.5% to 7.2%.
In 1984, Reagan won in a major landslide by winning 49 out of the 50 American states. During his second term, Reagan focused on ending the Cold War. He held many meetings between Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. They first met at the Geneva Summit in 1985. Later they both discovered their passion of ending the war. Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ascended to power in 1985, and their summit conferences led to the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
Also during his second term, Reagan's Invasion of Grenada and bombing of Libya were popular in the US, though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the controversy over the Iran–Contra affair that revealed Reagan's poor management style.
Reagan's legacy.
They thought Reagan dominated this stretch of American history in the same way that President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal legacy dominated the forty years that followed. The Reagan Era included ideas and personalities beyond Reagan himself. Since leaving office in 1989, Reagan became one of the most popular Presidents of the United States. During the era, the United States underwent the largest peacetime economic boom in American history.
Reagan's characteristics.
Reagan is usually characterized as the leader of a conservative movement whose ideas, whether good or bad, overwhelmed the national policy making in areas such as taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and the Cold War. Liberals are annoyed by the Reagan Era, while conservatives extremely like it and thought it was the best thing to happen in American history.

Sri Lankan elephant

The Sri Lankan elephant ("Elephas maximus maximus") is one of the three subspecies of the Asian elephant ("Elephas maximus"). 
The other two subspecies are the Indian elephant ("Elephas maximus indicus") and the Sumatran elephant ("Elephas maximus sumatranus"). 
The Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of the three subspecies. They are about 11 ft tall, and can weigh up to 12000 lb. They eat leaves, shrubs, grasses, and other plants. 
This subspecies is the National animal of Sri Lanka and is native to the island country. It once lived over the entire island. They now live in the dry zones in the north, east, and southeast. These zones are mainly dry deciduous woodland, scrubland, grassland, and marshes. There is a small group in the rainforest. 
Sri Lankan elephants are sometimes working animals. They carry timber, transport passengers, and participate in public events like the Procession of Buddha's Tooth. They were many of them in the past. They were aggressively hunted. 
In modern times, these elephants can be seen in Sri Lanka's national parks and elephant orphanages. They have been declared an endangered species, and are protected by law. Killing one carries the death penalty.
Description.
Asian elephants are usually smaller than African elephants. Females are usually smaller than males. Life span is about 60-70 years in the wild, and over 80 years in captivity. Elderly elephants may starve to death when their teeth wear out or fall out. 
The Asian elephant's highest body point is on its head. The tip of their trunk is used like a finger. Their back is curved upward or level. 
Their ears are smaller than those of the African elephant. Their feet have more "nails" than those of African elephants. They have five "nails" on each front foot, and four on each back foot. 
Very few of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. A tusk is a very long tooth that protrudes from the elephant's mouth. An elephant with huge tusks is called a "tusker". Females have no tusks. 
Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies of the Asian elephant. Their shoulder height is between 6 and 11 ft. They weigh between 4,000 and 12,000 lb.
Like humans, apes, and dolphins, they have a large and well developed brain. They are very smart. Elephants have the largest brain of all land animals. They have very good memories. They can remember places, people, and events from long in the past. 
Their skin color is darker than that of the two other Asian subspecies. They may have large patches of skin color loss (depigmentation) on ears, face, trunk, and tummy. 
Distribution.
The Sri Lankan elephant was once widely distributed across Sri Lanka. Over the past two hundred years however, human land use and development has forced the elephant from the wet and fertile regions of the southwest to the drier regions of the north, east, and southeast. These drier areas are mainly deciduous woodland, scrub, grassland, and marshes.
Social lives.
Like the two other subspecies of Asian elephants, Sri Lankan elephants live in groups of individuals that are related by blood. The group is led by a matriarch. She is usually the oldest and most experienced female in the group.
Sometimes a group will join another group to become a clan. The clan may then join another group or clan to become a herd. Groups are female-centered, and consist of grandmothers, mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts. 
Immature male elephants are members of the group, but once they reach sexual maturity, the females drive them out of the group. These males may then join bachelor groups or live on their own.
Family ties.
A mature male elephant is a bull, and a mature female elephant is a cow. Their offspring are called calves. Calves suckle for 2 to 5 years, and develop close ties with their mothers. All cows in the group, clan, or herd will help in different ways to raise and protect the calves.
Male calves are more likely to leave their mothers to play. Play involves head sparring, mounting, charging, shoving, and chasing. Female calves play chasing and running games, throw sticks, and may attack imaginary foes. Both sexes play rough and tumble games with each other.
Male elephants.
When males reach sexual maturity in their early teens, the matriarch and other female members of the group will chase him away. These males will not be able to mate with their relatives. The babies of such close unions will likely be inferior elephants.
Young males often form bachelor groups. Only a very few of Sri Lankan male elephants develop tusks. Female do not have tusks. Males become more solitary as they grow older. Adult males join females only for mating. Males do not help in raising the young.
Feeding.
Sri Lankan elephants eat leaves, grasses, shrubs, and vines. They sometimes enter farm gardens and eat crop plants. Baby and young elephants feed mostly on different grasses. 
Sri Lankan elephants are both browsers and grazers. They walk along and eat, but also stand still and eat what they can reach.
Adult elephants eat 300-400 lb. of food per day to support their bulk. These elephants will eat for up to 16 hours a day to meet their need for food. They drink from 25 to 50 gallons of water daily.
Defecation.
The elephants use less than 50% of the food they eat. They produce huge amounts of manure. They defecate about 16–18 times a day, and produce about 220 lbs. of dung.
In the wild, this manure carries and spreads the undigested seeds in the elephant's diet. Their manure is a source of food for insects and birds.
Reproduction.
Asian male elephants reach sexual maturity during their early teens. At that time, they enter an annual phase called "musth". This is a period when they become sexually aggressive. They will fight other males to mate with a female.
Once a male and female have successfully mated, a baby elephant called a calf develops in the mother's womb. The calf is born after an 18 to 22 month period. At birth, the calf weighs about 220 lb. Twins are rare. 
Babies are weaned at 18 months to 3 years or longer. Female calves stay close to their mothers to strengthen their bonds; male calves venture away from their mothers to explore and play. 
Once a mother gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned. This results in a birth interval of 4 to 5 years. Mothers remain with their herd, but mature males are driven away.
Humans and elephants.
In the distant past, Sri Lankan elephants numbered in the hundreds of thousands. They lived in all zones of the island. They were aggressively hunted by Sri Lankans, other Asians, and Europeans. 
In the 19th century, a British officer was said to have killed 1,500 elephants. Other British officers held similar records. Between 1829 and 1855 alone, more than 6,000 elephants were captured and killed. 
In 2014, there was an estimated 4,000 elephants living on Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan elephant is protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka (FFPO), and killing it carries the death penalty. 
Sri Lankan elephants are important to the economic and cultural life of Sri Lanka. Some are working elephants. They are used to carry timber. These elephants are losing their jobs because tractors are replacing them. 
Elephants can be seen in protected areas and national parks. These elephants attract tourists. This trade improves the economy and the lives of Sri Lankans. 
The elephant has always been held in great cultural esteem in Sri Lanka. Rajah, a Sri Lankan elephant with tusks that nearly touched the ground, was declared a national treasure in 1985.
Sri Lankan elephants participate in ceremonies, processions, and other public events. The Esala Perahera (the festival of Buddha's tooth) is held annually in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is thought to date to the 3rd century BC. Elephants lead the procession, bearing the sacred tooth.
Endangered species.
Sri Lankan elephants face the same threats to survival as other Asian elephant subspecies do: the clearing of forests to make way for farms and other human developments has destroyed their living areas. 
Conflicts between elephants and humans have been the result. These conflicts have led to the death of both elephants and humans, and the destruction of property. The situation is complicated by the elephant's taste for crops grown by humans such as sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. 
In 1997, about 126 wild elephants were lost as a result of these conflicts. Conflict between government troops and a terrorist group called the Tamil Tigers has also put elephants at risk.

Holiday in Cambodia

"Holiday in Cambodia" is the second single off American hardcore punk band Dead Kennedys' debut studio album "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables". The song was released in May 1980. 
The cover art for the song was taken during the Thammasat University massacre on 6 October 1976 in Thailand. It shows a member of a right-wing crowd beating the corpse of a student protester with a chair. The song is against both Eastern totalitarianism and Western complacency. The original version of the song features the satirically quoted word "niggers", later performances of the song by the Dead Kennedys, as well as other artists have replaced the word with "brothers". Biafra, however, has often replaced the word with "blacks".
Lead singer Jello Biafra was sued by the other members of Dead Kennedy because he would not allow the song to be used in a Levi's Dockers commercial. Biafra opposed Levi's because he believes they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. The other members of the band said that they had had their royalties defrauded. "The record industry has been skimming royalties owed artists since the beginning," according to Dead Kennedys guitarist East Bay Ray. "This case is no different from blues musicians being taken advantage of in the twenties and thirties. Many people doubted the claims we made against our former record label back in 1998 but with this announcement there is no denying we were the victims here."

Antimatter fuel

Antimatter, when it comes into contact with regular matter, releases a huge amount of energy. This energy is in the form of an explosion. This explosion can be harnessed for electrical means (Creating electricity) or as a thrust (Because antimatter has to be created, it would be extremely inefficient to use for electricity.) Since newtons laws state that if you push something, you get pushed. That is how rockets work. The antimatter can be exploded and forced behind the rocket, pushing the rocket forward. But antimatter reactions can produce harmful discharges of high energy gamma rays. High energy gamma rays break down molecules in cells and can also make the rocket engines radioactive. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is currently doing research to reduce this harmful side effect.

List of mammals of Great Britain

This is a list of mammals of Great Britain. 
The Great Britain mammal fauna is impoverished compared with that of continental Europe. This is because there was only a short time between the last ice age and the flooding of the land bridge between Britain and the rest of Europe. The list only has land species which crossed before the creation of the English Channel, and those later brought in by humans.
Native (indigenous) species have three possible definitions:
This list includes mammals from the small islands around Great Britain and the Channel Islands. There are no endemic mammal species in Great Britain, although four distinct subspecies of rodents have arisen on small islands.
Rodentia.
Rodents make up the largest order of mammals, with over 40 percent of mammalian species. They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continuously and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the coypu (once introduced to Great Britain, but subsequently eradicated) can weigh up to 9 kg (15.5 lb).
Family: Castoridae (beavers)
Family: Cricetidae (voles)
Family: Muridae (rats, mice and relatives)
Family: Gliridae (dormice)
Family: Sciuridae (squirrels)
Lagomorpha.
The lagomorphs comprise two families, Leporidae (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas). Though they can resemble rodents, and were classified as a superfamily in that order until the early 20th century, they have since been considered a separate order. They differ from rodents in a number of physical characteristics, such as having four incisors in the upper jaw rather than two.
Family: Leporidae (hares and rabbits)
Hedgehogs.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Erinaceomorpha
The order Erinaceomorpha contains a single family, Erinaceidae, which comprise the hedgehogs and gymnures. The hedgehogs are easily recognised by their spines while gymnures look more like large rats.
Shrews and moles.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Soricomorpha
The "shrew-forms" are insectivorous mammals. The shrews and soledons closely resemble mice while the moles are stout-bodied burrowers. 
Bats.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Chiroptera
The bats' most distinguishing feature is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals in the world naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.
Even-toed ungulates.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Artiodactyla
The even-toed ungulates are ungulates whose weight is borne about equally by the third and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 artiodactyl species, including many that are of great economic importance to humans.
Odd-toed ungulates.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Perissodactyla
The odd-toed ungulates are browsing and grazing mammals. They are usually large to very large, and have relatively simple stomachs and a large middle toe.
Carnivora.
Superorder: Laurasiatheria
Order: Carnivora
There are over 260 species of carnivorans, the majority of which feed primarily on meat. They have a characteristic skull shape and dentition. 
Order: Cetacea.
Whales.
The order Cetacea includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully adapted to aquatic life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.
Introduced animals.
Diprotodontia.
Though most marsupials make up a great part of the fauna in the Australian region, the red-necked wallaby has been introduced and a feral population is currently breeding on the island of Inchconnachan, and at Loch Lomond in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. A smaller group is present on the Isle of Man, and the species is locally extinct in the Peak District, in Cumbria, and at Ashdown Forest in East Sussex.
Family: Macropodidae (kangaroos, wallabies, and kin)
Rodentia.
Rodents make up the largest order of mammals, with over 40 percent of mammalian species. They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continuously and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the coypu (once introduced to Great Britain, but subsequently eradicated) can weigh up to 9 kg (15.5 lb).
Family: Muridae (rats, mice and relatives)
Family: Gliridae (dormice)
Family: Sciuridae (squirrels)

Lauri Törni

Lauri Allan Törni (28 May 1919 – 18 October 1965), later known as Larry Thorne, was a Finnish Army captain. He led an infantry company in the Finnish Winter and Continuation Wars. After the wars, he moved to the United States. He then joined the American Army. He is known as the soldier who fought under three flags: Finnish, German (when he fought the Soviets in World War II), and American (where he was known as Larry Thorne) when he served in U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets) in the Vietnam War.
Early life and military service.
Lauri Allan Törni was born in Viipuri, Viipuri Province, Karelia, Finland. His father was a ship captain named Jalmari (Ilmari) Törni. His mother was Rosa (née Kosonen) Törni. He had two sisters: Salme Lesley (b. 1920) and Kaija Iris (b. 1922). When he was a boy, he was athletic. An early friend was future Olympic Boxing Gold Medalist Sten Suvio. He attended business school and served with the Finland Civil Guard. Then he entered military service and joined the 4th Independent Jaeger Infantry Battalion stationed at Kiviniemi.
Career.
World War II.
During the Winter War, he fought battles at Lake Ladoga. His courage was noticed by his commanders. At the end of the war, he received officer training. Then he was commissioned a Vänrikki (2nd lieutenant) in the reserves. After the Winter War, in June 1941, Törni went to Vienna, Austria. In Vienna, he received 7 weeks of training with the Waffen SS. Then he returned to Finland in July. Because he was a Finnish officer, he was recognized as a German Untersturmfuhrer.
Törni is famous because of his courage in the Continuation War (1941–44) between the Soviet Union and Finland. In 1943 he was the leader of "Detachment Törni". His infantry unit went behind enemy lines to attack the Russians. One of Törni's men was future President of Finland, Mauno Koivisto. The two served together during the Battle of Ilomantsi. This was the last Finnish-Soviet battle of the Continuation War.
Törni's unit caused many casualties on the Russian units. The Soviet Army placed a reward of 3 million Finnish Marks, equivalent to 650,000 USD, to anyone who captured Törni. Because of his courage, Törni was decorated with the Mannerheim Cross on 9 July 1944.
Törni was not happy when Finland made peace with the Soviets. The peace agreement required Finland to take up arms against Germany in the Lapland War. He left the Finnish Army. In 1945, he was recruited by a pro-German resistance movement in Finland. He traveled to Germany for saboteur training. He wanted to organize resistance in case Finland was occupied by the Soviet Union. He surrendered to British troops in Germany at the end of World War II. Then he returned to Finland in June 1945.
After he returned to Finland, he was arrested by ValPo, the Finnish national security agency. There was a trial for treason in 1946 because he had joined the German army. After the trial he received a 6 year sentence in January 1947. He went to prison in Turku, but he escaped in June. He was recaptured and went to a different prison. In December 1948, Finnish President Juho Paasikivi gave him a pardon.
United States.
In 1949 Törni, traveled with his wartime executive officer Holger Pitkänen to Sweden. They entered Sweden from Tornio to Haparanda (Haaparanta). From Haparanda they traveled by railroad to Stockholm. Törni stayed with the Baroness von Essen, who helped many Finnish officers following the war. Pitkänen was arrested and returned to Finland. Törni met and fell in love with a Swedish Finn, Marja Kops. They were engaged to be married. Looking for a new job before the marriage, Törni traveled to Caracas, Venezuela. Törni met one of his Winter War commanders, Finnish colonel Matti Aarnio, who lived in Venezuela. From Caracas, Törni hired on to a Swedish cargo ship, the "MS Skagen". The "Skagen" sailed to the United States in 1950. While in the Gulf of Mexico, near Mobile, Alabama, Törni jumped overboard and swam to shore. Now he was a political refugee. He traveled to New York City where he was helped by the Finnish-American community in the Sunset Park, Brooklyn "Finntown." There he worked as a carpenter and cleaner. In 1953, Törni received residence permit through an Act of Congress. The law firm of William J. "Wild Bill" Donovan (the former head of the OSS, America's wartime covert military organization) helped pass the law.
Törni joined the U.S. Army in 1954. The Lodge-Philbin Act was a special law that allowed non-citizens to join the army. He adopted the name Larry Thorne. While in the US Army, his friends were Finnish-American officers known as "Marttinen's Men." They helped Private Thorne join the Special Forces. While in the Special Forces, Thorne taught skiing, survival, mountaineering, and guerrilla tactics. In turn he attended airborne school. He advanced in rank and received a commission as a 2nd lieutenant in 1957. He was promoted to captain in 1960. From 1958 to 1962 he served in the 10th Special Forces Group in West Germany at Bad Tölz. While there he was second in command of a search and rescue mission in the Zagros mountains of Iran. The mission was very difficult and Thorne was praised because of its success.
In 1962 Thorne is shown as a lieutenant with the 10th Special Forces Group in a United States Army "The Big Picture" episode.
In November 1963 Thorne joined Special Forces unit A-734 in Vietnam. He fought in the Mekong Delta and received medals for bravery.
In 1965, Thorne transferred to Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV–SOG). This was a classified U.S. special operations unit. The unit focused on unconventional warfare in Vietnam. On 18 October 1965, Thorne was supervising a secret mission on a helicopter. The helicopter crashed in a mountainous area of Vietnam, 25 miles (40 km) from Da Nang. A rescue team went to the crash site. They could not find it because of the mountains and trees.
Shortly after his disappearance, Thorne was promoted to the rank of major.
Thorne's body was found in 1999. Also, the bodies of the helicopter crew were found. The bodies were formally identified in 2003. On 26 June 2003, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, section 60, tombstone 8136. The remains of the Vietnam casualties were buried with him.
Legacy.
In the 1990s, Törni's name became more and more well-known as a martial war hero. Several books were written about him. He was named 52nd in the "Suuret Suomalaiset" listing of famous Finns. In the 2006 "" ("Finnish Soldier") magazine listing, he was named most courageous of the Mannerheim Cross recipients.
In Finland, the survivors, friends, and families of Detachment Törni formed the Lauri Törni Tradition Guild. The Infantry Museum (Jalkaväkimuseo) in Mikkeli, Finland, has an exhibit dedicated to Törni, as does the Military Museum of Finland in Helsinki. Törni is considered as the primary hero by both Finnish Parachute Rangers and Coastal Rangers, the two elite Finnish army formations.
At Fort Carson, Colorado, headquarters building for Special Forces is named the Larry Thorne Headquarters Building. The Special Forces 10th Group presents the Larry Thorne Award to the best Operational Detachment-Alpha in the command each year. The Special Forces Association Chapter 33 in Cleveland, Tennessee is named after him. In 2010 he was named as the first Honorary Member of the United States Army Special Forces Regiment.
In the book "The Green Berets" by Robin Moore, the "Sven Kornie" (or Captain Steve Kornie) main character in the first chapter was based on Thorne.
In a 2013 book "Tuntematon Lauri Törni" ["Unknown Lauri Törni"], Juha Pohjonen and Oula Silvennoinen say that Törni's conviction for treason was correct. They say the SS training that Törni received at the end of World War II was to support a National Socialist coup in Finland. Törni Heritage Guild members Markku Moberg and Pasi Niittymäki disagree. They say Törni faced pressure from war and alcohol, but did not support Germany. Finnish historian Jussi Niinistö says Törni's training was motivated by patriotism.

Eilmer of Malmesbury

Eilmer of Malmesbury was an English monk, born around 980. He is known for having attempted one of the first human flights in history.
The reason Eilmer made his flight was that he needed to think of a way out whenever the Vikings would attack the abbey. He went up a church tower with his gliding equipment that he had made from willow or ash. He made a downward flight of some 200 meters or so - from at least 18 meters high.

Bay of Pigs Invasion

The Bay of Pigs Invasion was an attempt in 1961 to remove Fidel Castro from power in Cuba. The CIA trained Cuban exiles and these exiles launched an attack in a bay called the Bay of Pigs during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
The invasion was a failure and most of the attackers were captured or killed. There were several conflicts that led to this; including a lack of promised air support and a change in where the landing was to be launched. This was one of many unsuccessful attempts by the CIA to rid Cuba of Castro. One interesting fact is that the plan was originally put in motion by Eisenhower, but the attack was ordered by John F. Kennedy who only found out about the plan after his election.

Data science

Data science is the study of the extraction of knowledge from data. It uses various techniques from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics, probability models, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and high performance computing with the goal of extracting useful knowledge from the data. Data Science is not restricted to only big data, although the fact that data is scaling up makes big data an important aspect of data science.
A practitioner of data science is called a data scientist. Data scientists solve complex data problems using various elements of mathematics, statistics and computer science, although expertise in these subjects are not required. However, a data scientist is most likely to be an expert in only one or two of these disciplines, meaning that cross disciplinary teams can be a key component of data science.
Good data scientists are able to apply their skills to achieve a broad spectrum of end results. The skill-sets and competencies that data scientists employ vary widely.

In speech, APMV is usually referred to as "mimivirus". Until October 2011, when an even larger virus "Megavirus chilensis" was described, it had the largest capsid diameter of all known viruses. 
Mimivirus has a large and complex genome compared with most other viruses. Mimivirus, short for "mimicking microbe", is so called to reflect its large size and apparent Gram-staining properties.

Like the other very large viruses "Mimivirus", "Pithovirus" and "Megavirus", "Pandoravirus" infects amoebas. Its genome, with 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA, is twice as large as that of "Megavirus". It differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure.
Although the capsid of "Pithovirus" is 50% larger in size, "Pandoravirus" has the largest genome among all viruses.

Pithovirus

Pithovirus is a genus of giant virus which infects amoebae. It is a double-stranded DNA virus, and is a member of the clade of large DNA viruses. It was first described in 2014 after a viable specimen was found in a 30,000-year-old ice core harvested from permafrost in Siberia, Russia.
It is 50% larger in size than the previous largest known viruses, but "Pandoravirus" has the largest viral genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA.
"Pithovirus" has a thick, oval wall with an opening at one end. Internally, its structure resembles a honeycomb.
Its genome.
The genome of "Pithovirus" has 467 different genes, more than a typical virus but far less than "Pandoravirus". Its genome is much less densely packed than any other known virus. Two-thirds of its proteins are unlike those of other viruses. Despite the physical similarity with "Pandoravirus", the "Pithovirus" genome sequence shows that it is barely related to that virus. It more closely resembles members of some other virus families. These families all contain large icosahedral viruses with DNA genomes. The "Pithovirus" genome has 36% GC-content, similar to the "Megaviridae", in contrast to greater than 61% for pandoraviruses.
Replication.
The "Pithovirus"' genome is one circular, double stranded DNA (dsDNA) chromosome of about 610,000 base pairs (bp.) Its DNA translate into 467 different proteins. The genome encodes all the proteins needed to produce mRNA; these proteins are present in the purified virions. 
"Pithovirus" does its entire replication cycle in its host's cytoplasm, not the more typical method of taking over the host's nucleus.
Discovery.
"Pithovirus sibericum" was discovered in a 30,000-year-old sample of Siberian permafrost. The virus was discovered buried 30 m below the surface of a late Pleistocene sediment. It was found when riverbank samples collected in 2000 were exposed to amoebae. The amoebas started dying and were found to contain giant viruses. The authors said they got the idea to probe permafrost samples for new viruses after reading about an experiment that revived a similar aged seed two years earlier.
Although the virus is harmless to humans, its viability after being frozen for millennia raised concerns that global climate change and tundra drilling operations could lead to potentially dangerous viruses being unearthed. Other scientists deny that this poses a real threat.

Capsid

A capsid is the protein shell of a virus. It is made of several protein subunits. The observable 3-dimensional subunits are called 'capsomeres'. The capsid encloses the nucleic acid of the virus.
Capsids are broadly classified according to their structure. Some viruses, such as bacteriophages, have developed more complicated structures. The icosahedral shape, which has 20 equilateral triangular faces, approximates a sphere, while the helical shape is cylindrical. The capsid faces may consist of one or more proteins. For example, the foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid has faces consisting of three proteins called VP1–3.
Some viruses are "enveloped", meaning that the capsid is coated with a lipid membrane known as the "viral envelope". The envelope is got by the capsid from an intracellular membrane in the virus' host; such as the inner nuclear membrane, the golgi membrane, or the cell's outer membrane.

Bobbie Rosenfeld

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Fanny “Bobbie” Rosenfeld (December 28, 1904 — November 14, 1969) was a Canadian athlete in the 1920s. She competed in basketball, hockey, softball, speed skating, tennis, and track and field. During her career, she won two Olympic medals in track and field. She was also the Canadian record holder for the standing board jump, running broad jump and discus In 1949, Rosenfeld was one of the first people to be given a place in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame. In 1950, she was named Canada’s woman athlete of the first half-century by the Canadian Press.
Early years.
Fanny Rosenfeld was born on December 28, 1903 in Dnepropetrovsk, Russia. After Fanny’s birth the Rosenfeld family moved to Barrie, Ontario. Rosenfeld’s athletic ability was first noticed during a 100-metre dash that she ran for fun in a small track and field meet in 1923. She came first in the race, beating Rosa Grosse, the Canadian champion.
1928 Olympics.
Rosenfeld competed in the Olympics in Amsterdam in 1928. This was the first time that women were allowed to participate in track and field events at the Olympics. She was a member of the Matchless Six, the Canadian women’s track and field team. This team placed first in the 400-metre relay, won the gold medal and became national heroes. Rosenfeld also won the silver medal in the 100-metre dash and placed fifth in the 800-metre race.
Retirement from sports.
Soon after the Amsterdam Olympics, Rosenfeld found out she had arthritis (“Bobbie Rosenfeld”). This arthritis forced her to retire as an athlete in 1933 but she continued to be involved in sports as a coach and as a writer. In 1934, she coached the women’s track and field team for Canada. They competed at the British Commonwealth Games in London, England. From 1937 she started writing “Sports Reel”, a newspaper column in the Globe and Mail. Through her writing, she continued to remind women that they were “people” and they could do anything they wanted, including sports. 
Death and legacy.
Rosenfeld died on November 13, 1969. She was 65 years old. Her contributions are remembered in a number of ways. The Bobbie Rosenfeld Trophy has given to a female athlete every year since 1978. In Israel, she was introduced into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1981. A park in downtown Toronto was named after her in 1991. In 1996, Canada Post honoured her with a stamp.

Clidastes

Clidastes is an extinct genus of mosasaur from marine environments of the late Cretaceous. It was an agile and fast swimmer which cruised the surface or shallow waters hunting for prey.
"Clidastes" was one of the smallest of the mosasaurs, averaging 2 – in length, with the largest specimens reaching 6.2 m long. 
It had a delicate, slim form with an expansion near the tip of the tail. This enabled it to chase down the fastest of prey.

Nuclear membrane

The nuclear membrane is the membrane inside a cell that has the nucleus and nucleolus inside. It forms a double layer, which is called the nuclear envelope. It is connected to another group of membranes in the cell, the endoplasmic reticulum.
It is a double lipid bilayer membrane which surrounds the chromosomes and nucleolus in eukaryotic cells. 
The nuclear membrane has thousands of nuclear pores – large hollow proteins about 100 nm across, with an inner channel about 40 nm wide. They link the inner and outer nuclear membranes.
During cell division, the nuclear membrane breaks down to allow mitosis to take place.

Sir Bors the Younger is a fictional character in the King Arthur stories. He is one of the Knights of the Round Table. His father, Bors the Elder, was the King of Gaunnes. Bors the Younger and his brother, Lionel, rebelled against Claudas' court. Before they were captured by Claudas, the boys were rescued by one of the Lady of the Lake's servants. They, alongside Lancelot, grew up to become skilled knights. They then joined King Arthur's Round Table. Along with Galahad and Percival, Bors was one of the three to witness the wonders of the Holy Grail.
Bors is more known for his loyalty and faithfulness than his swordsmanship. Bors was always loyal to King Arthur, even if it meant risking his own life. Bors could be considered almost fearless, due to him never being afraid to fight beside other knights.

Maurice Richard

Maurice "Rocket" Richard (1921-2000) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played for the Montreal Canadiens. He played for 18 years (1942-1960) in the National Hockey League (NHL), totally 544 goals and 421 assistants, 965 points, in 978 regular season games played. His goals scored were the most in NHL history until Gordie Howe scored his 545th in the early 1960s. Richard is considered one of the fiercest competitors and prolific goal scorers who ever played in the NHL. The "Rocket", as he became known, was followed by his brother, Henri Richard ("Pocket Rocket"). They are both ranked in the top 100 NHL hockey players of all time, "Rocket" ranked # 5, with the "Pocket Rocket #30.
Playing career.
Richard's first goal was against the New York Rangers on November 8, 1942.The 1944–45 NHL season was a record-setting one for Richard.
He first set a new mark for points in one game when he made five goals and three assists in a 9–1 victory over the Detroit Red 
Wings on December 28, 1944; his eight points broke the previous record of seven held by three players； Richard broke the record on 
February 25, 1945, in a 5–2 victory over Toronto. Malone was on hand to present Richard with the puck used to score the 45th 
goal.Richard missed over 20 games of the 1951–52 season due to injury, but overcame another ailment in the playoffs.The 1952–53 season began with Richard in close pursuit of Nels Stewart's all-time NHL record of 324 goals.Richard fulfilled his promise to Canadiens' fans 
as he led Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in 1955–56. The season began with the arrival of his young brother Henri to the 
Canadiens roster.The playoff goal was Richard's last, as on September 15, 1960, he announced his retirement as a player. Richard had reported to Montreal's training camp that fall, but Selke compelled Richard to end his playing career, fearing he was risking serious injury. In Richard's retirement speech, he said he had been contemplating leaving the game for two years, and stated that at age 39, the game had become too fast for him.
Playing style.
Richard also called "the Comet" when his early playing career but 
then he was remark "The Rocket" because of his teammate Ray Getliffe, 
his style like rocket; his speed, strength and determination were all 
strong. His teammate Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because 
"when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". 
Goaltender Jacques Plante said it often showed in Richard's eyes and 
comparing it to "the rocket's red glare" referenced in " The 
Star-Spangled Banner ". When he flying his eyes were all lit up."
Personal life.
As Richard struggled both with the need to find a purpose to his 
post-retirement life and the fear of being forgotten, he attached his 
name to numerous endeavours. He acted as a consulting editor for a 
magazine titled Maurice Richard's Hockey Illustrated, owned the "544 / 9
Tavern" in Montreal, and was a pitchman for dozens of products, 
including beer, hair dye, car batteries, fishing tackle and children's 
toys. He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 
years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 
as head coach for the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association. 
He lasted only two games, a win and a loss, before finding himself 
unable to handle the strain of coaching.
Richard and his wife, Lucille, lived in Montreal where they raised 
seven children: Huguette, Maurice Jr., Norman, André, Suzanne, Polo and 
Jean. They had 14 grandchildren. Lucille died of cancer in 1994, two 
years after the Richards celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. 
Richard's companion late in his life was Sonia Raymond. It was announced
in 1998 that Richard was suffering from abdominal cancer. As his health
deteriorated, Richard was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and 
doctors suspected he had Alzheimer's disease. He died on May 27, 2000 of
respiratory failure as a result of his cancer.

Forgot About Dre

"Forgot About Dre" is the second single off American hip hop musician Dr. Dre's second studio album "2001". The song was released in January 29, 2000 and features vocals from Eminem. The song won a Grammy Award for "Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group" in 2001.
It was called a stand-out track by Stephen Thomas Erlewine. NME said of the song: "In case folks been smoking too much heavy 'chronic' lately, West Coast rap founder and scary legend Andre Young, aka Dr Dre, jogs their memories on 'Forgot About Dre'. "Who you think brought you the Eazy Es, Ice Cubes and DOCs, the Snoop- D-O-G-Gs and the group that said motherf-- the police?" yammers the one-time NWA lynchpin, ex Death Row playa, inventor of - G-Funk and occasional breaker of rival producers' jaws. Yo, indeed, big bad Dre's back and, despite a four-year gap since his last hardcore missive, the Doc's recent collaboration with Eminem on 'The Slim Shady LP' has kept his legend simmering." The song also won an MTV Video Music Award for "Best Rap Video" in 2000.

Brenda's Got a Baby

"Brenda's Got a Baby" is the debut solo single by American rapper 2Pac. It was featured on his debut studio album "2Pacalypse Now". The song also features vocals from Dave Hollister.
The song is about twelve year-old girl named Brenda who lives in a ghetto, has a baby by her cousin, and is not able to support it. She runs away from home, becomes a prostitute and is murdered. The song explores the issue of underage pregnancy and the effect on both the young mothers and their families. Like many of Shakur's songs, it draws from the trouble of the poor. By using Brenda to represent young single mothers in general, Shakur criticises the lack of support from the father of the baby, the government, and society in general. He wrote the song after he read an article in the newspaper about a twelve-year-old girl who got pregnant by her cousin and threw the baby in a trash compactor.

Plating

Plating is a surface covering in which a metal is put on another metal surface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years, and it is important for modern technology. 
Plating is used to decorate objects, prevent corrosion, to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to allow painting, to alter conductivity, and for other purposes. Jewelry typically uses plating to give a silver or gold finish. Objects can be plated with films as thin as a single atom, so plating finds uses in nanotechnology.
There are several plating methods, and many variations. In one method, a solid surface is covered with a metal sheet, and then heat and pressure are applied to fuse them (a version of this is Sheffield plate). Electroplating is a very common method.

<doc id="448135" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448135" title="Kaworu Nagisa">
Kaworu Nagisa

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
Kaworu Nagisa is a character from Neon Genesis Evangelion. He appears in episode 24 of the television show, sent to Nerv by Seele in order to replace the pilot of Unit 02, Asuka Langley Soryu, whose synchronization ratio has fallen too low for her to pilot her Evangelion. Kaworu is both the Fifth Child and the 17th Angel. He and Shinji Ikari enjoy a brief friendship, in which Kaworu tells Shinji that he loves him and that he was probably born to meet him. Soon after Kaworu is discovered as the 17th Angel, however, Shinji is forced to kill Kaworu so that humanity can survive. Kaworu's last words are "Thank you. I'm glad I met you" (to Shinji), and in the aftermath of Kaworu's death, Shinji states that he loved him too, and that Kaworu should have been the one to live.
Kaworu Nagisa reappeared in the film End of Evangelion to first weaken Unit 01's AT field so that Instrumentality could commence, then later in Shinji's mind along with Rei Ayanami to help Shinji choose the decision to reject Instrumentality in favor of individual thought and form, even if it meant having to deal with pain again.
Manga appearance.
Kaworu Nagisa is portrayed much differently in the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga. While the original series depicted Kaworu as selfless, eloquent and loving, the Kaworu in the manga is awkward and invasive. Even with a new characterization, however, Kaworu still displays attraction towards Shinji, even kissing Shinji in an attempt to stop Shinji's hyperventilation, and verbally wondering what it would be like if Shinji "came to love [him]". When Kaworu's nature as an Angel is revealed, he again forces Shinji to kill him, saying that this way, he will not be able to forget him.
Neon Genesis Evangelion New Theatrical Version.
In the "Neon Genesis Evangelion New Theatrical Version" (also known as "Rebuild of Evangelion"), Kaworu plays a slightly bigger role. He first appears near the end of "1.0: You are (not) alone", waking up in a coffin on the moon. He then stands up and looks to the earth, commenting that "the Third hasn't changed", and that he is looking forward to meeting him (Shinji Ikari). 
In "2.0: You can (not) advance", Gendo Ikari and Kozo Fuyutsuki visit Seele's moon base to observe the construction of Unit 06, and see Kaworu sitting atop Unit 06's finger, wearing only pants. Kaworu seems to address Gendo as "Father", although it is unknown whether he meant it literally or metaphorically. Kaworu is also briefly seen putting on a plugsuit, still on the moon, while Mari Illustrious Makinami gets ready to battle Zeruel in the Geofront. His last appearance in 2.0 is at the very end of the movie, after the credits roll. What is presumably a Lance of Longinus is hurled down towards earth and ends up impaling Unit 01, halting Third Impact. Kaworu is then seen descending towards earth in Unit 06, with an uncharacteristically angry look on his face. He promises that this time, he will bring Shinji happiness. 
In the next movie, "3.0: You can (not) redo", Kaworu plays a much larger role. As Asuka and Shinji in Unit 01 fall down to earth, Kaworu says that he has been waiting for Shinji. He is next seen playing piano in Nerv HQ, after Shinji is brought there by Unit 00. Shinji's father later informs Shinji that he is to copilot a new Evangelion unit, Unit 13, alongside Kaworu (not saying Kaworu's name). Kaworu then calls out to Shinji, and requests that he play piano. He is hesitant at first, but with Kaworu's guidance the two are able to play a duet together quiet beautifully, despite Shinji's claim that he could not play. Kaworu introduces himself, and tells him that they are both children bound by fate. Kaworu and Shinji continue to play piano together (which indirectly helps them synchronize to activate Unit 13 together later on), and come to see each other as friends, Kaworu commenting that he "really was born to meet" him - an almost exact quote from his role in the original series. When Shinji expresses his fear at what happened in the 14 years he was gone, Kaworu shows him the destruction of near-Third Impact, emphasizing that it was all brought about by Shinji, but also assuring him that "there is always hope" and later telling Shinji that together, they can fix everything with the two spears in Central Dogma. 
Prior to piloting Unit 13, Kaworu removes the DSS choker from Shinji's neck and places it on his own so that Shinji will not have to fear death while they activate Unit 13. After descending to Central Dogma in order to retrieve the spears, however, Kaworu realizes that something is off. He urges Shinji not to take the spears, but Shinji shuts off his controls and removes them anyways. Shortly after this, Fourth Impact starts and Unit 13 awakens. The DSS choker begins to activate, and Shinji is driven to despair with the knowledge that he caused Fourth Impact and that Kaworu, perhaps his only friend at this point, is about to die. 
In spite of everything, Kaworu claims that it was he who was the trigger for Fourth Impact, because he became the 13th Angel. Before dying, Kaworu apologizes to Shinji for not being able to bring him happiness and promises that they will meet again. The collar then detonates, leaving Shinji near-comatose, similar to his state at the start of End of Evangelion.

IOS 7

iOS 7 is the seventh major version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. It replaced the last major version, iOS 6. The new version was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013, and it was released on September 18, 2013. iOS 7 includes a new, redesigned look and has a number of changes. The latest update (or minor version), iOS 7.1.2, was released on June 30, 2014.
History.
iOS 7 Beta 1 was released to developers on June 10, 2013. It supported the iPhone 4 and later, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation). iOS 7 Beta 2 was released on June 24, 2013, two weeks after the first beta was released. It added support for the iPad 2 and later, as well as the iPad Mini. Two weeks later, iOS 7 Beta 3 was released on July 8, 2013. Until iOS 7 Beta 4, a new beta was being released every two weeks. iOS 7 Beta 4 was released on July 29. 2013, three weeks after the third beta was released. The fifth beta, iOS 7 Beta 5, was released on August 15, 2013, and brought many fixes and improvements.
At their iPhone event on September 10, 2013, Apple announced that iOS 7 would be officially released to everyone on September 18, 2013, for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.
Apple released iOS 7.1 on March 10, 2014 and it is the first major update to the operating system since it was first released in September 2013. It was released almost 5 months after the first beta of iOS 7.1 was released to developers. It made several improvements to the operating system including performance improvements and Siri enhancements. It also adds support for a new feature called CarPlay, which works by connecting an iPhone to a car that has a touchscreen. It is currently available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5S.
Design.
iOS 7 was announced during the first keynote of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013. It was the "biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone", because the most noticeable change was a change to the entire operating system. In a video that was shown during the keynote, the update had many changes to the app icons, adding layers, and using translucent effects throughout the operating system. iOS 7's design departs from elements like green felt in Game Center, wood in Newsstand, and leather in Calendar, in favor of a flat, colorful design.
Features.
AirDrop.
A new feature called AirDrop is introduced in iOS 7. It supports the iPhone 5 and later, the iPod Touch (5th generation), the iPad (4th generation) and later, and the iPad mini (1st generation) and later. With AirDrop, you can share files, photos, videos, and more by turning on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and choose the person you want to share with. You can make yourself discoverable to your contacts or everyone.
App Store.
The App Store introduces a new feature called Popular Near Me, which allows the user to find apps that are popular in their area. The App Store also supports automatic updates, meaning that apps will update by themselves and that the user does not have to update the apps.
Camera.
The Camera app has a new look and supports video recording, camera, and panorama mode (on some iPhone and iPod touch models), as well as a new square photo mode. iOS 7 also includes photo filters, a new Burst mode, and 120 fps video recording (on devices that support it).
Control Center.
A new feature, Control Center, can be seen by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

Biochemical cascade

A biochemical cascade (or signalling pathway) is a series of chemical reactions. It is started by a stimulus (first messenger) acting on a receptor. The 'message' is passed on to the cell interior through other reactions. These later chemical reactions amplify (build up) the initial signal. Eventually there is a cell response to the initial stimulus. The passing series of chemical changes is a cascade, and the whole process is called signal transduction.

Complement system

The complement system helps or “complements” the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism. It is part of the innate immune system. 
The complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the blood, made by the liver. Normally they circulate as inactive precursors ("pro-proteins"). When stimulated by a trigger, proteases split specific proteins to release active cytokines. This starts a series (a cascade) of further cleavages which release more cytokines. This amplifies (makes bigger) the response. So, if the original stimulus was an invading bacterium, the cytokines disrupt the phospholipid bilayer cell membrane of the target, which kills it.

Turpin was born in Hempstead, Essex. He was firstly believed to be involved with a gang of poachers, who stole and sold deer that belonged to the King. The rest of his gang were captured and hanged in 1735.
After this, Turpin started robbing rich people on the highways between cities. He didn't stay in one place, so police could not catch up with him. He robbed people across the South of England. For a while, he tried to hide by calling himself John Palmer.
However, people were suspicious that he had a lot of money, and he was arrested for horse theft. He was charged with this offence and hanged in Knavesmire, York on 7 April 1739.

Glacial lake

A glacial lake is a lake that is made as a glacier melts. The glacier erodes the land, and then as it melts, water fills the hole or space that has been created. 
Near the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago, glaciers began to retreat. A retreating glacier often left behind large amounts of ice in hollows between drumlins or hills. As the ice age ended, these melted to create lakes. This can be seen in the Lake District in Northwestern England. Glacial lakes are often surrounded other evidence of the glacier including drumlins, moraines, eskers, striations and chatter marks.
The glaciers crush minerals in the rock as they pass over them. These minerals become sediment at the bottom of the lake, and some of the rock flour becomes suspended in the water. These minerals support a large population of algae, making the water look green.
These lakes can be seen in aerial photos of landforms in:
The coastlines near these areas are often very irregular, formed by the same geological process. Other areas have fewer lakes that often are part of river systems. Their coastlines are smoother. These areas were carved more by erosion

Salt lake

A salt lake, or saline lake, is a lake with a lot of sodium chloride and other dissolved minerals in the water. It is often defined as three grams or more of salt per litre. In some cases, salt lakes have more salt than sea water: they are called hypersaline lakes. An alkaline salt lake with a high content of carbonate is called a soda lake.
Salt lakes can be put into categories based on salinity:
Salt lakes form when the water flowing into the lake, containing salt or minerals, cannot leave. This is because the lake is endorheic (a dead end). The water then evaporates, leaving behind any dissolved salts. This increases its salinity. Salt lakes are an excellent place for salt production. High salinity will also lead to a unique flora and fauna in the lake. Sometimes the large amount of salt means there is little life in or near the lake.
If the amount of water flowing into a lake is less than the amount evaporated, the lake will eventually disappear and leave a dry lake: a 'playa', salt flat or salt pan.

Lake Hindmarsh

Lake Hindmarsh, in western Victoria, Australia, is the state’s largest natural freshwater lake. The nearest towns are Jeparit to the south and Rainbow to the north. It is a large shallow lake which is often dry. The lake filled after floods in 2011, having been dry for nearly ten years.
History.
The area around the lake is the traditional country of the Gromiluk, a group of the Wotjobaluk people. Explorer Edward Eyre camped at Lake Hindmarsh in 1838 while searching for an overland route from Melbourne to Adelaide. By 1845 Europeans were settling near lake. In 1859 the Moravian Ebenezer Mission was established nearby.
Geography.
Lake Hindmarsh is the first lake of the Wimmera River Terminal Wetlands. Its water comes directly from the Wimmera River. When full, the lake covers 13500 ha, is 3.4 m deep and holds 378 GL of water. It is a wetland of national significance. If Lake Hindmarsh overflows, water flows on to the deeper Lake Albacutya, which is a Ramsarwetland of international importance.
Because it is so shallow, water in Lake Hindmarsh evaporates quite quickly. When it is full, evaporation from the lake is around 140,000 ML per year. As the Wimmera River usually only adds about half that amount, the lake is rarely full. It takes three to four years to evaporate entirely.
The lake was full during the wet years of the early to mid-1970s. It had a commercial fishing industry. The lake was used for water sports, including water-skiing. The lake filled in 1996, but then received no further water from the Wimmera River and had dried up by 2000. It remained dry for almost a decade. 
In October 2009, water from the Wimmera River trickled into Lake Hindmarsh for the first time in 13 years. The 2010 Victorian floods raised water levels higher many birds returned to the lake. After the January 2011 Victorian floods, it was hoped the Wimmera River would fill the lake and overflow into the northern lakes. However, outlet creek remained dry and the lake again awaits its next flooding event.

Lake Tuscaloosa is a reservoir in west-central Alabama. It was created by damming North River. It was built to provide water for people living in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and also for industrial use. It was completed in 1970. It cost about $7,725,000. The lake is very popular for recreational activities.
History.
Lake Tuscaloosa was built because because more people were living in Tuscaloosa. The reservoirs already there, Harris Lake and Lake Nicol, didn't provide enough water. A dam was built on North River. When that dam filled, the water behind it became Lake Tuscaloosa. Lake Tuscaloosa provides more water than either of the other two reservoirs. Lake Tuscaloosa's water is treated to make it safe for people to drink. It also provides untreated water for industrial use.

The lake is part of the Wimmera River Terminal Wetlands. Water enters the lake from Outlet Creek which only flows when Lake Hindmarsh overflows. Water from the Wimmera River flows into Lake Hindmarsh. When full water from Lake Albacutya flows along Outlet Creek, and begins to fill further small lakes and wetlands to the north. This has not happened since 1976.
Because the lake has less salt than Lake Hindmarsh, Lake Albacutya supports a denser cover of vegetation in its dry phase. 
The lake has not received any inflow for some years and remained dry throughout the wetter years of 2011-2012.

The lake is used for watersport, including sailing, rowing and water skiing. The foreshore has a playground and a boat ramp. The Colac Botanical Gardens are next to the lake. In January 2009, the lake dried up after years of drought. Water enters the lake from Barongarook Creek, but the lake usually loses more water through evaporation. The lake needs to get water from rain falling directly over it to keep up a high level. Water quality in Lake Colac is low because of nutrients, such as phosphorous and nitrogen entering the lake. This has come from farms and untreated sewerage. There has also been chemicals and rubbish from the town of Colac. These can cause blue green algae to grow in the lake which makes the water unsafe for humans or animals. There have been efforts made to improve water quality by stopping these nutrients from getting into the lake. 
The lake has redfin, eels and carp, and in 2013 it was proposed to put estuary perch into the lake.

NXT Women's Championship

The NXT Women's Championship is a professional wrestling championship in the WWE. The title is a NXT-only championship. It is competed for between the women's wrestlers.
History.
The title was introduced at WrestleMania Axxess on April 5, 2013. On the May 30, 2013 tapings of "WWE NXT", Stephanie McMahon announced that there would be a tournament between four developmental talents and four main roster Divas. Paige defeated Emma in the tournament finals to become the first NXT Women's champion. 
After Paige debuted on the main roster and won the WWE Divas Championship, she held both championships. On the April 24, 2014 episode of NXT, NXT Commissioner JBL stripped Paige of the NXT Women's Championship because of her not being able to defend the NXT Women's Championship as the WWE Divas Champion.
Another tournament was started the following week. Sasha Banks would qualify over Bayley, Natalya would qualify over Layla, Alexa Bliss would qualify over Alicia Fox and Charlotte would qualify over the former number-one contender, Emma. During the semifinals, Natalya defeated Sasha Banks, and Charlotte defeated Alexa Bliss. At "NXT Takeover", the finals took places and Charlotte defeated Natalya to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship.
Current champion.
The current champion is Sasha Banks, who is in her first reign. She won it after defeating Bayley, Becky Lynch, and then-champion Charlotte in a Fatal 4-Way match at "" on February 11, 2015.

Trophic state index

The trophic state index (TSI) is a measure of how much nutrient, such as nitrogen and phosphorus are in a lake, or other body of water. Nutrients increase plant growth, and raise the trophic levels. The TSI can be used to make an estimate of the biological condition of a lake.
Carlson's Trophic State Index.
Carlson's Index is a Trophic State Index. It is used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The "trophic state" is the total weight of biomass in a given water body at the time of measurement. The Carlson index uses the algal biomass to classify a lake's trophic status. 
Index variables.
Three variables are used to work out the Carlson Index: "chlorophyll pigments", "total phosphorus" and "Secchi depth". Chlorophyll is the most accurate measure, as it is the best predictor of biomass. Phosphorus may be better in summer. Secchi depth is the least accurate measure, but it is the cheapest and easiest to use. It measures how clear the water is. This shows how much dissolved and particulate material is in the water. This can be used to work out the biomass.
Trophic classifications.
A lake can be put into one of three possible classes: "oligotrophic", "mesotrophic" or "eutrophic". Lakes with extreme trophic indices can also be called "hyperoligotrophic" or "hypereutrophic". Each trophic class has different types of fish and other organisms which live in them. If there is too much algal biomass in a lake or pond, then many fish can die as the decomposing biomass takes the oxygen from the water.
Oligotrophic.
Oligotrophic lakes have very little or no aquatic vegetation and the water is clear. They have low levels of nutrients. The water is suitable as drinking water. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have lots of oxygen; thus, such lakes often support many fish species. Lake trout, for example, need cold, oxygen rich water. The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes, because of their larger amount of dense cold water.
Oligotrophic lakes are most common in cold areas. They are often on top of a layer of igneous rocks (especially granitic bedrock).
Mesotrophic.
Mesotrophic lakes are lakes with a medium level of productivity. They usually have clear water with beds of submerged aquatic plants and medium levels of nutrients.
The term mesotrophic is also applied to terrestrial habitats. Mesotrophic soils have moderate nutrient levels.
Eutrophic.
 relarticle mainpage">Main : Eutrophication
Eutrophic lakes have large amounts of organisms, including algal blooms. They have a lot of nutrient and can support a lot of
aquatic plants and algae. Usually the water body will be dominated either by aquatic plants or algae. When there are a lot of aquatic plants the water tends to be clear. When there is a lot of algae the water tends to be darker. The process of photosynthesis in the algae supplies oxygen to the fish and plants which live these waters. Sometimes an excessive algae bloom will occur. This can kill fish by using all the oxygen in the water. The process of eutrophication can occur naturally and by human impact on the environment.
"Eutrophic" comes from the Greek "eutrophos" meaning "well-nourished", from "eu" meaning good and "trephein" meaning "to nourish"
Hypereutrophic.
Hypereutrophic lakes are very nutrient-rich lakes with frequent large algal blooms and low transparency. Hypereutrophic lakes have a visibility depth of less than three feet. They also have high levels of chlorophyll and phosphorus. The algal blooms can also reduce oxygen levels which can cause dead zones beneath the surface.
Trophic Index drivers.
Both natural and human actions can decide a lake or other water body's Trophic Index. A lake in a nutrient-rich region may be
naturally eutrophic. Nutrients carried into water bodies, such as agricultural runoff, residential fertilisers, and sewage will all increase the algal biomass, and can easily cause an oligotrophic lake to become hypereutrophic.
Management targets.
Often, different people want different trophic states. For example duck hunters may want a lake to be eutrophic so that it will support large numbers of ducks. Residents, on the other hand, may want the same lake to be oligotrophic, as this is more pleasant for swimming and boating. Natural Resource agencies are generally responsible for managing the different demands and deciding what a lake's trophic index should be.

Ullswater

Ullswater is the second largest lake in the English Lake District. It is about nine miles (14.5 kilometres) long and 0.75 miles (1,200 m), wide with a maximum depth of slightly more than 60 m.
Many regard Ullswater as the most beautiful of the English lakes, it has been compared to Lake Lucerne in Switzerland. 
It is a typical Lake District narrow "ribbon lake" formed after the last ice age when a glacier scooped out the valley floor. When the glacier retreated, the deepened section became a lake.Three separate glaciers formed the lake. The surrounding mountains give Ullswater the shape of a stretched 'Z' with three distinct segments (or 'reaches') that wend their way through the surrounding hills.
For much of its length Ullswater forms the border between the ancient counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.
The village of Glenridding, at the southern end of the lake, is popular with tourists of all kinds. For mountain walkers, England's third highest mountain, Helvellyn and other challenging peaks are near the lake. The village has ample accommodation including two Youth Hostels and camp sites. The village of Pooley Bridge is at the northern end of the lake. Its narrow 16th-century bridge straddles the River Eamont as it flows out of Ullswater; it is overlooked by Dunmallard Hill, which was the site of an Iron Age fort. On the western side of the lake is Aira force waterfall. Near there the Brackenrigg Inn overlooks sweeping views of the dramatic landscape.

Derwent Water

Derwent Water or Derwentwater is one of the main lakes in the Lake District National Park in north west England. It is in the Borough of Allerdale in the county of Cumbria.
The lake lies immediately south of the town of Keswick. It is both fed and drained by the River Derwent. It is about 3 mi long by 1 mi wide and is some 72 ft deep. There are several islands in the lake, one of which is inhabited. Derwent Island House, an 18th-century residence, is a tenanted National Trust property open to the public on five days each year. 
Derwentwater is very scenic. It is surrounded by hills (known locally as fells), and many of the slopes facing Derwentwater are wooded. A regular passenger launch operates on the lake, taking passengers between various landing stages. There are seven lakeside marinas, the most popular stops being: Keswick, Portinscale and the Lodore Falls, from which boats may be hired. Recreational walking is a major tourist activity in the area and there is a network of footpaths in the hills and woods surrounding the lake.
The Keswick—Borrowdale road runs along the eastern shore of the lake and carries a regular bus service. There is a lesser road along the western shore connecting the villages of Grange and Portinscale.
Derwentwater gave its name to the Earldom of Derwentwater.
The lake is believed to be the last remaining native habitat of the vendace ("Coregonus vandesius") fish.

Ennerdale Water

Ennerdale Water is the most westerly lake in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria. It is a glacial lake, with a maximum depth of 150 feet (45 metres). At ½ mile to a mile (700 to 1,500 metres) wide and 2½ miles (3.9 kilometres) long is one of the smallest lakes in the area. To the west of the lake lies the small village of Ennerdale Bridge, with of two pubs and a few houses. It is close to the port of Whitehaven, the town of Cleator Moor and the village of Cleator.
Legends and facts.
The Girt dog of Emmerdale.
In 1810 a large carnivore killed hundreds of sheep in and around Ennerdale before it was hunted down and killed. The Girt (dialect for 'Great') Dog of Ennerdale was a mysterious creature that killed between 300 and 400 sheep over six months in the fells of Cumberland, England, in 1810. 
It is now commonly thought that the Girt Dog of Ennerdale was a thylacine (otherwise known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf.) Travelling circuses and menageries of the time were known to keep what were described as “tiger wolves” – a description that fits the thylacine perfectly. As import laws and animal control were so relaxed in the early part of the nineteenth century, an escape from one of these itinerant shows is easy to imagine.
Other.
Though the Lake District is a popular UK location for film shoots, Ennerdale has been left relatively in the shadow, with only a few brief exceptions. The closing sequences of the film "28 Days Later" (2002), directed by Danny Boyle, were filmed around the Ennerdale area, and include a sweeping, panoramic view of the lake.
Once a year, during the last week in August, the Ennerdale Show brings local people together with agricultural displays, competitions, arts and crafts. 
Former US President Bill Clinton proposed to his wife Hillary on the banks of Ennerdale Water in 1973.

<doc id="448362" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448362" title="Lake Mungo">
Lake Mungo

For the movie, see Lake Mungo (movie).
Lake Mungo is a dry lake in the south-western part of New South Wales, Australia. It is about 760 km due west of Sydney and 90 km north-east of Mildura. The lake is the main feature of Mungo National Park. It is one of 17 lakes in the World Heritage listed Willandra Lakes Region. 
Many important archaeological discoveries have been made at the lake. This includes Mungo Man, the oldest human remains found in Australia, and Mungo Lady, the oldest human remains in the world to be ritually cremated. 
It is also the site of the "Lake Mungo geomagnetic excursion," the first convincing evidence that Geomagnetic excursions are a geomagnetic phenomenon rather than sedimentological.
Geology.
Sediments at Lake Mungo have been deposited over more than 100,000 years. On the eastern shore of the lake are the 'Walls of China'. These are a 26 km long series of lunettes, about 30 metres high, formed over thousands of years. There are three distinct layers of sands and soil forming the Walls. The oldest is the reddish Gol Gol layer, formed between 100,000 and 120,000 years ago. The middle greyish layer is the Mungo layer, deposited between 50,000 and 25,000 years ago. The most recent is the Zanci layer, which is pale brown, and was laid down between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago.
The Mungo layer, which was deposited before the last ice age period, is the most archaeologically rich. It was a time of low rainfall and cooler weather, but more rainwater ran off the western side of the Great Dividing Range, keeping the lake full. It supported a large human population, as well as many varieties of Australian megafauna.
During the last ice age period, the water level in the lake dropped, and it became a salt lake. This made the soil alkaline, which helped to preserve the remains left behind in the Walls of China. Although the lake completely dried up several thousand years ago, ground vegetation remained on the Walls. This which helped to stabilise them and preserve them. With the arrival of European settlers in the area in the 1880s, introduced species, mostly rabbits, sheep and goats have destroyed the vegetation cover. This has led to increased erosion of the dunes. However, this erosion has led to the uncovering of many human and animal remains. Wind has moved sand and soil eastwards from the Walls, forming a mobile sand dune which moves further east every year.
Archaeology.
The most important findings at Lake Mungo have been Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. Mungo Lady, a partly cremated body, was discovered in 1969 by Dr Jim Bowler from the Australian National University (ANU). At first she was thought to be 25,000 years old. A more recent study in 2003 found that she was probably closer to 40,000 years old. Mungo Lady is the earliest known human to have been cremated. Mungo Man was also discovered by Dr Bowler, on 26 February 1974. The remains were covered with red ochre, in what is the earliest known incidence of such a burial practice. Although some studies have shown his age at more than 60,000 years, the current agreement is that he is also about 40,000 years old.
Humans have been living around Lake Mungo for at least 50,000 years. Stone tools have been found in the dunes which are older than the Mungo Man. Grinders for making flour have been found which are between 5,000 and 10,000 years old; they were made of sandstone sourced from the
Murray River basin 100 km away. A stone axe head, at least 500 years old, was also found in the dunes; it was made from stone from Mount Camel, near Shepparton, well over 300 km away.
The rich archaeological heritage of the site is very significant to the Aboriginal Australian people from the area. The Willandra region is home to the Barkindji, Nyiampaa and Mutthi Mutthi people. They have Joint Management Agreements with the Government of New South Wales to manage the lake and the Mungo National Park.
Lake Mungo Geomagnetic Excursion.
In 1972, Archaeomagnetic studies were carried out on the prehistoric aboriginal fireplaces found along the ancient shoreline of Lake Mungo. Magnetization preserved in oven-stones and baked hearths show that the axial dipole field moved up to 120 degrees from its normal position around 30,000 years ago. This is called a geomagnetic excursion. Because most of the excursions found before Lake Mungo were in sedimentary material, it had been thought that the magnetic field directional anomalies were detrital or diagenetic in origin. The Lake Mungo results were due to thermoremanent magnetization, ruling out a sedimentological phenomena. 
Two excursions have been recorded in sediments from Skjonghelleren on Valderøy, Norway. The Virtual Geomagnetic Pole (VGP) of one happened at the same time as Lake Mungo which suggests the event was global rather than local. Data from lake sediments of a similar age in France having near identical magnetic field lines also support Lake Mungo being a global event. However, it has been suggested that Lake Mungo's anomalous field is the result of lightning strikes.

Gippsland Lakes

The Gippsland Lakes are a network of lakes, marshes and lagoons in east Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. They cover an area of about 354 km2. The largest of the lakes are Lake Wellington, Lake King and Lake Victoria. Water enters the lakes from the Avon, Thomson, Latrobe, Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo rivers.
History.
The Gippsland Lakes were formed by two main actions. The first was by silt from the rivers creating river deltas. The Mitchell River created silt jetties which run into Lake King for several kilometres. The second action was the sea in Bass Strait which created the Ninety Mile Beach which blocked the rivers from reaching the sea.
Once the rivers were blocked the water level of the lakes would gradually rise. The water would finally break through the barrier beach and the level would drop to sea-level. Eventually the beach would close-off the lakes and the cycle would begin again. Sometimes it would take many years before a new channel to the sea was formed and it was not always in the same place as the last one.
In 1889 a wall was built to fix the position of a natural channel between the lakes and the ocean at Lakes Entrance. This stabilised the water level, made a harbour for fishing boats and opened the lakes to shipping. This entrance needs to be dredged regularly, or the same process that created the Gippsland Lakes would maker the entrance too shallow for ships to pass through.
Due to the flooding, in 2011, Gippsland Lakes were experiencing bioluminescence.
Environment.
The lakes support numerous species of wildlife. There are two protected areas: The Lakes National Park and Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park. The Gippsland Lakes wetlands are protected by the international Ramsar Convention on wetlands. There are also approximately 400 indigenous flora species and 300 native fauna species. Three plants, two of them being orchid species, are listed as endangered.
Burrunan dolphins.
The lakes are home to about 50 Bottlenose dolphin, the Burrunan dolphin ("Tursiops australis").
Birds.
The wetlands provide habitat for about 20,000 waterbirds. This includes birds from Siberia and Alaska. The lakes have been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they regularly support over 1% of the global populations of Black Swans, Chestnut Teals and Musk Ducks, as well as many Fairy Terns.
Geography.
The Gippsland Lakes are, in order of size:
Lake Wellington.
Lake Wellington covers an area of 148.19 square kilometres. It is connected to Lake Victoria by McLennan Strait. 
Lake Victoria.
Lake Victoria covers an area of 78.14 square kiolmetres.
Lake King.
Lake King covers an area of 96.84 square kilometres.
Lake Reeve.
Lake Reeve is a long lake, with many salt marshes.
Lake Tyers.
Lake Tyers is is not connected to the other Gippsland Lakes, and makes its own entrance to Bass Strait.
Lake Coleman.
The eastern shore of Lake Coleman is part of the Lake Coleman Wildlife Reserve. There is also a small reserve on the western shore called the Lake Coleman West Wildlife Reserve. The reserve covers an area of about 1500 hectares. Most of Lake Coleman is used by the Department of Defence for training purposes.

Charles Shane Robinson (born July 2, 1964) is an American professional wrestling referee. He is currently working with the WWE where he has been working 2001.
Robinson started out as a photographer for Pro Wrestling Federation (PWF) in 1995.
World Championship Wrestling.
On September 15, 1997, He refereed a tryout dark match between Chris Taylor and Kendall Windham before WCW Monday Nitro at Independence Arena in Charlotte, NC. A week later, he was signed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW).
His first appearance for WCW was at the WCW TV tapings at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. He turned heel, refereed Four Horsemen matches and aligned himself with Ric Flair. During his heel run, he favored the Horsemen in matches he refereed which annoyed Randy Savage. Savage, who was suspended by Flair (then-WCW President), proposed a match between Robinson and Savage's girlfriend Gorgeous George where if George defeated Robinson, Savage would be reinstated. The match took place on May 9, 1999 at "Slamboree 1999". Robinson (dubbed "Little Naitch") copied Flair's signature strut, "wooo!" catchphrase and even wore a robe similar to Flair's. Robinson would lose the match after George hit him with a diving elbow drop.
World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE.
When the World Wrestling Federation bought WCW in March 2001, they hired Robinson. Robinson was a part of The Alliance. The first match that he refereed in the WWF was on July 2, 2001. Even though he was a part of the Alliance, he was mainly a fair and impartial referee. On the July 1, 2004 episode of "SmackDown!", he was forced to wrestle Luther Reigns by then-General Manager Kurt Angle. The match was quickly stopped by Charlie Haas however.
On April 18, 2014, while he was traveling with the WWE in Saudi Arabia, he suffered a freak accident after he nearly lost his thumb when he deeply cut it while helping to set up the wrestling ring. He received 6 stitches from a nearby WWE medic.

<doc id="448496" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448496" title="Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)">
Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)

Lake Macquarie or Awaba, is the largest coastal salt water lake in Australia. It covers an area of 110 km2. It is on the coast of New South Wales, north of Sydney. The city of lake Macquarie is on the shores of the lake. Lake Macquarie is connected to the sea by a short channel.
History.
Aborigines of the Awabakal nation lived in the area for thousands of years. The name "Awaba", means "a plain surface".
The first European to discover the lake was Captain William Reid in 1800. Reid had been sent from Sydney to get a load of coal from Newcastle Harbour. Reid took a wrong turn and found himself in a lake rather than a river, with no coal to be seen anywhere. The name "Reid's Mistake" was used until 1826, when it was renamed in honour of Governor Lachlan Macquarie.
Geography and environment.
The lake is an irregular shape. The land between the lake and the sea is only a few kilometres wide along most of its length. There are several small, sandy, low-level islands in the lake. Pulbah Island, located south of Swansea is a large island with rocky cliffs. It covers an area of 68 ha. Pulbah is an Aboriginal name meaning "island". Pulbah Island is also a sacred site for the Awabakal people.
Lake Macquarie is connected to the sea by Swansea Channel and Lakes Entrance. Swansea Channel is about 380 m wide and 2 km long. The bridges over the channel can lift to allow yachts and other boats in and out of the lake.
Important Bird Area.
The eucalypt forests on the southern edge of the lake have been listed by BirdLife International as a 121 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA). They support significant numbers of endangered Swift Parrots and Regent Honeyeaters. Masked Owls and Ospreys often nest in the area.
Environmental management.
In 1983 the State Pollution Control Commission studied the poor water quality of Lake Macquarie. It found increased amounts of sediment and increased levels of nutrients were causing problems. Further studies in 1995 found that creeks flowing into the lake were causing many of these problems. In 1998 a special group was set up by the government to find ways to protect the lake. This group recommended setting up the Lake Macquarie Project Management Committee. Their job was to put in place an action plan to protect the lake called the Lake Macquarie Improvement Plan. 
These actions have included reducing the amount of sediment and nutrients getting into the lake. They have built wetlands, stormwater treatments, replanting, and educating the local community.
There are more fish in the lake because commercial fishing has been stopped in the lake and the water quality is improving.
Recreation.
Fishing, boating, kayaking and water skiing are all popular activities on the lake.

Blue Lake (South Australia)

Not to be confused with :Little Blue Lake.
The Blue Lake is in Mount Gambier, South Australia. It is in an extinct volcanic crater, which is part of the Mount Gambier complex. It is one of four crater lakes on Mount Gambier. Leg of Mutton Lake and Brown Lake have dried up over the past 30 to 40 years as the water table has dropped. The Blue Lake is known for its changing color, from grey to bright blue.
Different dates have been given for its last eruption, of 28,000 years ago, 4300 years ago, and, recently, a little before 6000 years ago. If the youngest date is correct, this could be the most recent volcanic eruption on the Australian mainland.
Blue Lake is thought to be of an average depth of 72 metres, but in places reaches 77 metres deep. The crater rim measures 1,200 metres (3,937 feet) by 824 metres (2,703 feet). The lake itself measures 1,087 metres (3,566 feet) by 657 metres (2,155 feet). The bottom of the lake is 30 metres (100 feet) below the level of the main street of the nearby town. The Blue Lake supplies the town with drinking water.
Studies.
In 1967 a survey found the deepest point in the lake at 77 m. Major diving exploration of the lake first took place in 1985. Cave diver Peter Horne studied the temperature and visibility of the water. He discovered a fresh water sponge species and other invertebrates. He also discovered "The Stromatolite Field", hollow rock formations on the north-eastern edge at a depth of 40 m. In 2008 another dive brought up core samples from the calcite-silt covered lake bed, and measured the water temperature on the lake bed at 14 degrees Celsius (57 °F).
Colour change.
During December to March, the lake turns to a vibrant cobalt blue colour. It changes to a colder steel grey colour for April to November. Why this happens is still a mystery. Scientists believe water on the surface becomes warmer in summer. This causes calcium carbonate to precipitate out of solution and allows micro-crystallites of calcium carbonate to form. This results in scatter of the blue wavelengths of sunlight. During winter the lake water becomes well mixed, and the lake water is less clear because of tannins and calcium carbonate particles. The angle of the sun has also been found to influence the perceived colour of the lake. The movement of planktonic life-forms within the lake during the seasons and during the day may also play a part in the colour change.
Gordon's Leap.
In July 1865 Adam Lindsay Gordon performed the daring horse riding feat known as Gordon’s Leap on the edge of the Blue Lake. A commemorative obelisk was built at the spot. The sign on it reads: "This obelisk was erected as a memorial to the famous Australian poet. From near this spot in July, 1865 Gordon made his famed leap on horseback over an old post and rail guard fence onto a narrow ledge overlooking the Blue Lake and jumped back again onto the roadway. The foundation stone of the Gordon Memorial Obelisk was laid on 8th July 1887".

Probability space

Probability space is a mathematical model used to describe scientific experiments A probablity space consists of three parts:
An "outcome" is the result of a single execution of the model. Since individual outcomes might be of little practical use, more complex "events" are used to characterize groups of outcomes. The collection of all such events is a "σ-algebra" formula_1. Finally, there is a need to specify each event's likelihood of happening. This is done using the "probability measure" function, "P".
Once the probability space is established, it is assumed that “nature” makes its move and selects a single outcome, "ω", from the sample space Ω. All the events in formula_1 that contain the selected outcome "ω" (recall that each event is a subset of Ω) are said to “have occurred”. The selection performed by nature is done in such a way that if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times, the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would coincide with the probabilities prescribed by the function "P".
The prominent Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov introduced the notion of probability space, together with other axioms of probability, in the 1930s.

The Gambler (novel)

The Gambler is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 
It is about the bad side of gambling and has to do with Dostoyevsky's own experiences from his travels to Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden and other casinos. At the time when he wrote The Gambler he had serious financial problems. The Gambler was also turned into an opera by Sergei Prokofiev.
Background.
The Gambler was made public in 1867 short time after Crime and Punishment. In the summer 1865 Dostoyevsky had promised to his publisher Stellovsky to create a novel until 1. November. Otherwise the publisher would get the publishing rights for other works of Dostoyevsky without having to pay. Dostoyevsky accepted this. So Dostoyevsky dictated the novel in only 26 days to his typist and later wife Anna. Stellovsky left St. Petersburg on 31. October to make the delivery impossible. But Anna had the idea to deliver the novel to a notary (a kind of a lawyer) and like that they were able to deliver the novel until the promised date.

Ground sloth

 
Ground sloths are a group of extinct large sloths in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra. 
The term "ground sloth" is used as opposed to the much smaller living "tree sloths". Their most recent survivors lived in the Caribbean Antilles, where they may have survived until about 2819 and 2660 BC. This was the last known occurrence of "Megalocnus" in Cuba. Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more. Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some island sloth populations persisted 5,000-6,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives. This fits the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal.
Most ground sloth evolution took place during the mid to late Tertiary of South America while the continent was isolated. At their earliest appearance in the fossil record, the ground sloths were already distinct at the family level. The presence of intervening islands between the American continents in the Miocene allowed a dispersal of forms into North America. A number of mid- to small-sized forms are believed to have previously dispersed to the Antilles islands either by making short swims or using land bridges. Ground sloths were a hardy group: their numbers and dispersals into remote areas are evidence of this. Remains have been found in Patagonia (Cueva del Milodón), and parts of Alaska.
Sloths, and xenarthrans as a whole, were one of the more successful South American groups during the Great American Biotic Interchange. In general, during the interchange, many more taxa moved from North America into South America than in the other direction. However,at least five genera of ground sloths have been identified in North American fossils; these are examples of successful migration to the north.

Paramylodon

Paramylodon is an extinct genus of ground sloth. It was endemic to North America in the Pliocene, and to the end of the Pleistocene epoch. It lived from around ~4.9 million years ago (mya) to 11,000 years ago.
"Paramylodon" was about 3 m (9.8 ft) in height and weighted as much as 1089 kg. It is known from deposits in the United States, Mexico and as far south as Guatemala.
There is just one recognized species, "P. harlani", (Owen) 1840, which is commonly referred to as Harlan's ground sloth in honor of the American paleontologist who first discovered and described a lower jaw in 1835. 
Like the South American "Mylodon", "Paramylodon" had dermal ossicles: small bones embedded in the skin. This made it harder for predators if they attacked from behind. Its skull and teeth suggest it was, like the other members of its group, a browser on leaves and small branches. It ate standing on its hind legs and using its huge hands to pull the vegetation into its mouth. Skeletons found in the La Brea tar pits were more or less complete.

Wilfred Thesiger (June 3, 1910 – August 24, 2003) was born in Addis Ababa where his father was an advisor to the Ethiopian emperor. He went to school and university in England but he always dreamed of travel. He didn't make many friends when he studied in England. During his first university holidays he travelled alone, without much money, from England to Istanbul. This was the start of an exciting life filled with adventure in Africa, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula. 
Thesiger was one of the last great British explorers and he was an excellent photographer and writer. When Thesiger died in 2003, he left more than 38,000 photographs to the Pitt Rivers museum in Oxford. Thesiger wrote many books, some of which are considered to be classics. He was a tall, strong man and a successful boxer. 
Thesiger travelled through the UAE with his Bedouin friends and even met Sheikh Zayed in Al Ain. (In 2003, the UAE gave money to the Pitt Rivers museum to help keep Thesiger's photos safe). Thesiger had a deep respect for his Bedouin friends who he thought of as better than himself because they were generous, brave and always cheerful. Each time Thesiger and his Bedouin friends met other people, they stopped, invited them to eat their food, and enjoyed sharing the latest news. 
Thesiger loved a simple lifestyle. He didn't like cars or the radio. For the rest of his life he always wanted to go back to the desert.
He died in Croydon, London.

Penny Arcade is a webcomic about video games. It was created by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik. The comic debuted in 1998. Now, the comic has its own website which also hosts other comic strips. In addition, the site has information about Child's Play, a children's charity, and PAX, a gaming convention. Both are by Holkins and Krahulik.
The Comic Strip.
The comic strip is about two characters who are based on the creators of the comic strip. John "Gabe" Gabriel is based Mike Krahulik, and Tycho Brahe is based on Jerry Holkins. Gabrial is happier, but can become very angry. Tycho Brahe (named after the astronomer Tycho Brahe) is unhappy and serious. The characters go through the same events their creators do, but react differently. Most of the comic strips involve the two characters commenting on nerd culture, usually video games. The strip has large amounts of cursing and has been known to offend people.
Other Media.
Krahulik and Holkins have released podcasts called "Downloadable Content" since March 20, 2006. A series of four video games loosely based on the comic strip titled "" began on May 21, 2008. Tycho appeared in the game "Poker Night at the Inventory" alongside characters from "Team Fortress 2", "Strong Bad" and "Sam & Max". "Penny Arade: The Series" is a reality televesion show about the strip and the Penny Arcade company that began on February 20, 2010.

There are two ways that natural and man-made things can use rotation to move around. One way is for the entire thing to roll. The other way is for part of the thing to turn while the rest does not, like a wheel or a propeller. Some living things move around by rolling, but no living things seem to use wheels. Biologists have written about the reasons for this. Writers of science fiction and fantasy have invented many animals with wheels.
Wheels are a very useful technology for people. Many technologies that people use are also found in nature, like wings and lenses.
It may seem strange, then, that wheels have never evolved in nature, but there are two reasons for this. First, there are natural limits to what kinds of things can exist in nature. Living things change slowly over time, a process called evolution by natural selection. This process can create many different answers to a problem, but it can't always create every answer that can be imagined. Also, the ways that new living things build themselves (a process called developmental biology) can't always create every kind of part that can be imagined. Second, wheels are sometimes less useful than other ways of moving, like walking, running, or slithering like a snake. For the same reason, some groups of people in the past have given up using wheels completely. 
Known examples of rolling and wheels in living things.
Rolling.
Some living things move around by rolling. These are not true examples of wheels, because the whole organism rotates, without any parts that stay still, like an axle.
Some kinds of animals form their bodies into a circle. In some cases, they do this to protect themselves, and in some cases they do it to be able to roll. Animals that do this include some caterpillars, tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, and salamanders. Other animals form into a ball instead. These animals include pangolins, hedgehogs, armadillos, the armadillo lizard, isopods, the wheel spider, and fossilized trilobites. These animals may roll "passively", meaning they are pushed by gravity or wind, or "actively", meaning they push themselves by changing their shape. Tumbleweeds are a part of a plant that grows above the ground. Tumbleweeds break off from their roots and roll in the wind in order to spread their seeds.
Dung beetles form round balls of animal feces. They roll these balls with their bodies. Although the ball rolls instead of the beetle, the beetles have many of the same problems as rolling animals.
A kind of skin cell called a keratinocyte moves itself by rolling, as part of the process of healing.
A kind of tiny animal called a rotifer uses a ring of cilia (small hair-like parts) moving in rhythm to move and feed itself. The word "rotifer" in Latin means "having wheels", but rotifers do not actually have any parts that rotate.
Rotation like a wheel.
No known multicellular organism (an organism made of many cells) can spin part of its body while keeping the rest of its body still. However, there are at least two examples of rotating parts used by cells. One example is a molecule called ATP synthase. ATP synthase is used to store and move energy. For example, it is used in the processes of photosynthesis (a way of storing energy from the sun) and oxidative phosphorylation (a way of releasing stored energy). ATP synthase is similar to flagellar motors, which are talked about below. Biologists (scientists who study life) think that ATP synthase is an example of modular evolution. In modular evolution, two parts with different jobs join together and pick up a new job.
The only known example in nature of a part that can spin all the way around to push an organism is the flagellum. The flagellum is a tail used like a propeller to push single-celled prokaryotes. The bacterial flagellum is the best known example. About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum. This means that rotation may actually be the most common way of moving around found in nature.
At the bottom of the bacterial flagellum, where it meets the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as an engine. This engine gets its power from proton motive force, the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the cell membrane. This is caused by a concentration gradient (a difference in the number of protons on each side of the membrane) created by the cell's metabolism. (Bacteria called "Vibrio" use two kinds of flagella, one of which is powered by sodium ions instead.) Flagella are very efficient, meaning not much energy is wasted. They can push bacteria as fast as 60 times their length every second. The motor at the bottom of the flagellum has a similar structure to ATP synthase. Bacteria called spirillum have twisted bodies with flagella on both ends. Spririllum bacteria spin around as they move.
A kind of organism called archaea, which are different from bacteria, also use flagella powered by rotating motor proteins. The two kinds of flagella evolved from different parts. Eukaryotic cells are a more complex kind of cell found in plants and animals. Some of these cells also have flagella called cilia, but these flagella do not rotate at the bottom. Instead, they bend so that the tip of the flagella moves in a circle.
Barriers to wheels in biology.
Limits of evolution.
The science of evolution can help to explain why multicellular organisms have not developed wheels. To put it simply, a complex structure (one made of several parts working together) can't evolve unless its early, unfinished form helps the organism to live and to have children.
In the modern science of evolution, adaptations (changes that affect the fitness of an organism) appear slowly, over many generations, by means of natural selection. Because of this, genetic changes usually only spread in a population if they do not lower the fitness of individuals. Neutral changes (changes that don't raise or lower fitness) can spread by genetic drift. In some cases, changes that lower fitness can spread, but large changes that take many steps can only spread if each of the steps raises fitness. The biologist Richard Dawkins describes the situation this way:
Error: No text given for quotation (or equals sign used in the actual argument to an unnamed parameter)
In this metaphor, fitness is a landscape, where useful traits are peaks and harmful ones are valleys. Wheels may be a very useful peak, but the valley around that peak is too low or too wide for the gene pool (the set of genes in the population) to move to it by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould points out that evolution can only build with parts that are already available. He writes that, "wheels work well, but animals are debarred [(prevented)] from building them by structural constraints [(limits)] inherited as an evolutionary legacy."
Natural selection therefore explains why wheels have not appeared. A wheel without one or more of its important parts would probably not help an organism very much. However, the same is not true for the flagellum discussed above. As the flagellum evolved, different parts of other structures were used for a new purpose. The part that is now a rotating motor, called a basal body, may have evolved from a part that was used by bacteria to inject poisons into other cells. This use of existing parts is called "exaptation".
The biologist Robin Holliday has written that, because there are no living things with wheels, creationism and intelligent design (stories of life that claim an intelligent creator) are less likely to be right. Holliday argues that an intelligent creator, free from the limits of evolution, would use wheels in any place they would be useful.
Limits of bodies and how they grow.
People have found it fairly easy to build wheeled systems, even complex ones, and they have been able to solve problems of power transmission (moving energy from one place to another) and friction. However, the ways new organisms build themselves are very different from the ways humans build things. It is not clear that the processes of life would be able to make a wheel. The reasons for this are talked about below.[#endnote_foreign 1]
The greatest barrier to many-celled organisms with wheels is the interface (meeting point) between the parts that move and the parts that stay still. Wheels, or wheels and axles, need to be able to turn freely relative to the rest of the organism. Animal joints have a limited range of motion (the angle they can move), but wheels need to be able to turn through any angle without needing to be turned back. Because of this, wheels can't be attached to the axle or shaft that they turn on. No true many-celled organism is known to grow solid tissues or organs that are not attached to the rest of the organism.
Sending power to wheels.
To drive a wheel (that is, to make it turn), something must put a torque (twisting force) on it. For machines made by people, this torque is usually made by a motor. There are many kinds of motors, such as electric motors, turbines, and steam engines. Torque can also come from a person, as with a bicycle. In animals, movement is usually caused by skeletal muscles. These muscles get energy by metabolizing (breaking down) the nutrients in food. Skeletal muscles are attached with connective tissue to the bones they move, so they would not be useful for driving a wheel directly. Also, animals use their muscles in cycles - joints move in one direction, then the other, instead of moving in one direction constantly. Large animals cannot gain speed very quickly, because it is more difficult for muscles to pull against a large inertia (the resistance of a heavy object to movement).
Friction.
In most machines, a lubricant (like oil or grease) or a bearing is used to limit friction (rubbing) between moving parts. Keeping friction down is important for limiting wear damage to the parts, and for keeping the parts from getting too hot. The faster the parts move, or the more force between them, the more important it is to reduce friction. In animal joints like the human knee, friction is reduced with a tissue called cartilage that has a low coefficient of friction, and a lubricating fluid called synovial fluid that has a low viscosity (resistance to flowing). Gerhard Scholtz, a professor at the "Institut für Biologie Vergleichende Zoologie" 
 
 ("Institute for Biology and Comparative Zoology") at Humboldt University of Berlin, has written that a similar lubricating fluid or material from dead cells could help an animal wheel to turn freely, but something like this has never been seen in nature.
Moving nutrients and waste to and from a wheel.
Another problem is the flow of materials to and from a living wheel. If the tissues that form the wheel are living, then they must receive oxygen and nutrients and have wastes taken away in order to continue metabolism (the process of using energy to maintain functioning). A normal animal circulatory system (the network of tubes that allow blood to flow), would not be able to provide for the necessary flow of materials. Without blood flowing, materials would have to diffuse to and from the wheel. Diffusion is limited by partial pressure and surface area, by a rule called Fick's law of diffusion. For large animals, diffusion would not be enough to keep tissues alive. Instead of a living wheel, a wheel could be made of dead material like keratin, which makes up hair and nails.
Problems with wheels.
In some environments, wheels are simply not as good as limbs for getting around. So it may be that, even if it were possible for wheels to evolve, they would not be found often in nature. In fact, given the limits of wheels, the main question can be turned around: instead of asking ""Why doesn't nature use wheels?", the question becomes "Why don't people build more machines with limbs?"" In engineering, wheels are often used instead of limbs, because limbs are more complex to design and control—not because wheels necessarily do the job better.
Efficiency.
Rolling resistance.
On hard, flat ground, like paved roads, hard wheels are more energy efficient than other ways of moving around. However, wheels are not as efficient (they take more energy to move) on soft surfaces, like soils, because they have to deal with "rolling resistance". In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy as the shape of the wheel and the surface are deformed (changed), and the surface pushes back against the wheel. Smaller wheels have to deal with more resistance for their size than larger wheels. Softer surfaces deform more than hard surfaces, and they don't come back to their starting shape as well. This causes greater resistance. Compared to concrete, the resisting force on medium-hard soil can be five to eight times greater, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs only cause a small deformation at the point that the foot touches the ground.
Rolling resistance is also the reason that some human civilizations didn't use wheels. During the Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa. However, when the Empire fell, wheels became less useful to the local people, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. Stephen Jay Gould wrote about this strange fact of history in his book "Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes". He wrote that without maintained roads, camels needed less human power and water than a cart pulled by oxen.
Efficiency of movement in water.
When moving in water, rotating mechanisms are more efficient only when the "Reynolds number" of the flow is very low. The Reynolds number is a way to describe the behavior of a flow—in a flow with a low Reynolds number, like those in which bacteria move, viscosity is the most important effect to consider. In flows with high Reynolds numbers, inertia is the most important effect, and mechanisms that "oscillate", or move back and forth, are more efficient. Although ship propellers usually have an efficiency near 60%, and aircraft propellers around 80% (up to 88% in the human-powered "Gossamer Condor"), oscillating foils like fish tails and bird wings can be as efficient as 96%−98%.
Traction.
Wheels can slip, meaning they fail to get a grip, on loose or slippery ground. Slipping wastes energy, and can lead to loss of control or becoming unable to move. This happens to cars on mud, ice, and snow. Where wheels have this problem, people sometimes use other mechanisms instead. In the logging industry, vehicles with legs are sometimes used to reach areas that are more difficult than what wheels can deal with. Vehicles with tracks, like tanks, don't slip as much as vehicles with wheels, because they have a larger area touching the surface. However, vehicles with tracks often have a larger turning radius than wheeled vehicles, meaning they take more space to turn. They are also less efficient, and more complex to build.
Dealing with obstacles.
The engineer Mieczysław G. Bekker showed that in natural terrain, small obstacles are much more common than large ones. This is called a "log-normal" distribution. This means that obstacles are a problem for wheeled vehicles of all sizes. The main ways of dealing with obstacles are to go around them, and to go over them.
Going around obstacles.
The most common types of steering do not include separate articulation (joints for bending) for each wheel, so they have a limited turning radius. This limits how well these kinds of vehicles can move around where there are a large number of obstacles.
Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago shows the limited turning radius of wheels by comparing humans walking with humans in wheelchairs. Jared Diamond points out that most examples of rolling in nature are found in wide open, hard terrain. This includes the use of rolling by dung beetles and tumbleweeds.
Going over obstacles.
Wheels are bad at dealing with vertical (upright) obstacles, especially obstacles about the same size as the wheel itself. If a vehicle or animal can move its center of mass, then the largest vertical obstacles that can be climbed are half as high as the wheel. If the center of mass cannot be moved, the highest obstacle that can be climbed is one eighth to one quarter the height of the wheel.
Also, without joints, a wheeled vehicle can become stuck (unable to move) on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels so they don't touch the ground. Limbs, unlike wheels, are useful for climbing, and can deal with difficult terrain.
For wheels without joints, climbing obstacles will cause the body of the vehicle to tilt. If the weight of the vehicle moves outside of the wheels, the vehicle can tip over because of "static instability". At high speed, a vehicle's inertia can cause it to become "dynamically unstable". This means it can be tipped over by a smaller obstacle, or simply by turning or changing speed too quickly. Without jointed limbs, it can be impossible to recover from being tipped over.
Use of limbs for different jobs.
Limbs used by animals to move over terrain are often also used for other purposes, such as holding and manipulating things, climbing, swinging from branches, swimming, digging, jumping, throwing, kicking, and grooming. Without joints, wheels are not as useful as limbs for these jobs.

Buddy Roemer

Charles Elson "Buddy" Roemer III (born October 4, 1943) is an American politician and banker. He served as the 52nd Governor of Louisiana from 1988 to 1992. He last served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1988.
Roemer was a candidate for the presidential nominations of the Republican Party and the Reform Party in 2012.
In March 1991, while serving as governor, Roemer switched his party from the Democratic to the Republican Party. In 2012, he became a member of the Reform Party.
Early life.
Roemer was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. His parents were Charles Elson "Budgie" Roemer, II and Adeline McDade. He was raised in Bossier City.
In 1964, he graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. In 1967, he received an MBA in finance from Harvard Business School. After college, Roemer returned to Louisiana to work in his father’s computer business and later founded two banks. He was elected in 1972 as a delegate to the Louisiana Constitutional Convention held in 1973.
U.S. House of Representatives (1981-1988).
As a member of Congress, Roemer Louisiana's 1st congressional district in the northwestern section of the state, anchored about Shreveport and Bossier City. After his 1980 election victory, Roemer won congressional re-election without opposition in 1982, 1984, and 1986.
In Congress, Roemer frequently supported Reagan policy initiatives and fought with the Democratic congressional leadership, though he remained in the party. He also criticized then Democratic House leader Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts for being "too liberal".
After Roemer left the House to become governor, he was succeeded by his administrative assistant, Republican Jim McCrery.
Governor of Louisiana (1988-1992).
Roemer was one of a large number of Democratic candidates to challenge three-term incumbent governor Edwin Edwards. Roemer won the election by winning 33% of the vote compared to Edwards' 28%.
Roemer entered the governor's office on March 14, 1988. In October 1989, voters rejected a number of Roemer tax initiatives but approved a constitutional amendment for transportation improvements. Facing a $1.3 billion deficit in the state budget, his first job was eliminating the deficit. Roemer called a special session of the legislature to push an ambitious tax and fiscal reform program for state and local governments. He vowed to slash spending, abolish programs, and close state-run institutions. Voters rejected his proposals in a statewide constitutional referendum.
In March 1991, Roemer switched to the Republican Party just months before the state elections, apparently at the urging of Bush White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. Roemer lost his re-election after loosing the Republican primary to David Duke. Duke would soon loose to Edwin Edwards.
Roemer left office on January 13, 1992. He would run again for the Republican nomination for governor, but lost to Mike Foster.
2004 U.S. Senate election.
In the summer of 2004, Roemer briefly considered entering the race to succeed retiring U.S. Senator John Breaux. Roemer shortly after decided not to run for the senate.
2012 presidential campaign.
 relarticle mainpage">Main : Buddy Roemer presidential campaign, 2012
In January 2011, Roemer told Baton Rouge television station WAFB that he was considering a bid for the U.S. presidency in 2012. On July 21, 2011 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, Roemer announced his entry as a candidate for the Republican nomination for President. On November 30, 2011, Roemer officially announced that he would seek the Americans Elect nomination. On February 23, 2012, Roemer dropped out of the GOP nomination to seek the Reform Party's nomination. On May 17, 2012, Americans Elect announced that it would not run a candidate in the 2012 presidential elections. 
On May 31, 2012, he announced that he was ending his 2012 presidential campaign altogether, citing the lack of ballot access to be the reason
2015 gubernatorial election.
Roemer has not yet announced on whether or not that he will run for Governor of Louisiana again in 2015 to replace Bobby Jindal.
Personal life.
Roemer was married to Cookie Delmer until they divorced. Then he married Patti Crocker until they divorced. He is now married to Scarlett Roemer. Roemer has three children with Delmer.

Pine nut

Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus "Pinus"). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting. Other pines have edible seeds too small to be useful as a human food.
Pine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are often added to meat, fish, salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread. In Italian they are called "pinoli". They are an essential part of Italian pesto sauce.
Pine nuts can be pressed to extract pine nut oil, which is valued for its mild, nutty flavour. The large edible seeds of the Southern Hemisphere conifer genus "Araucaria" produce nuts rather like pine nuts.

Argument from authority

Argument from authority or appeal to authority is a form of argument or reasoning which may give rise to a fallacy when misused.
In informal reasoning, the appeal to authority is an argument of the form:
Statistically, that may often be right. However, it might be wrong in a particular case. In "that" case, it would be a fallacy. Thus, the appeal to authority is not a generally reliable argument for establishing facts.

Brampton Bryan Castle is a castle in the small village of Brampton Bryan in north-western Herefordshire, England, 50m south of the River Teme. The castle guarded an important road from Ludlow along the Teme Valley to Knighton and on into Central Wales.
The castle is listed in the Domesday Book (1086). In 1295 it was described as a "tower with curtilage". The castle was almost entirely destroyed during the Civil War. The ruins that are still standing include an outer gate house, parts of the inner gatehouse, part of the south wall of the kitchen, and the great hall.
When Bryan de Brampton died in 1294, his son-in-law, Robert Harley, inherited the castle. For almost 700 years since the castle has remained in the Harley family. During the Civil War, the castle was defended by Lady Brilliana Harley, the wife of Robert Harley. Harley was a puritan and a Member of Parliament.

Technical support scam

A technical support scam is a form of telephone fraud that tricks people by pretending that they are a service which helps people fix their computers. In most cases they convince the victim they have a computer problem that does not actually exist. A common type is when someone gets a call from someone (usually from places like India or Pakistan) pretending to be from a company that sounds real such as "Microsoft" or "Windows" support. Often the caller tries to gain the victim's trust. They may use confusing and very technical language to sound authentic. They may ask the victim to perform several tasks on their computer. Often they target legitimate files on the victim's computer saying these are viruses. These tactics are designed to scare people into letting the scammer fix the problem (that does not really exist). The caller may have the victim install malicious software that could capture sensitive data, such as online banking passwords or credit card information.

Sidewinding

Sidewinding is a type of locomotion unique to some snakes. They use it to move across loose or slippery ground like sand or mud. It is often used by the Saharan horned viper, "Cerastes cerastes", and the sidewinder rattlesnake, "Crotalus cerastes", to move across loose desert sands. It is also used by some snakes in Southeast Asia to move across tidal mud flats. Other snakes can be induced to sidewind on artificial smooth surfaces, with various degrees of success.
Sidewinding is done by simply lifting all the segments with the same slope off the ground. In the movement, the snake's body is always in static (as opposed to sliding) contact with the ground. The head seems to be "thrown" forward, and the body follows, being lifted from the prior position and moved forward to lie on the ground ahead of where it was originally. Meanwhile, the head is being thrown forward again. In this way, the snake slowly progresses at an angle, leaving a series of mostly straight, J-shaped tracks. Because the snake's body is in static contact with the ground, imprints of the belly scales can be seen in the tracks, and each track is almost exactly as long as the snake.
Below is a crude animated line-drawing showing sidewinding in action. The light brown areas are the tracks left behind, and show where the body of the snake touched the ground. 
This mode of locomotion overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body. The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing. This mode of locomotion has very low caloric cost, less than ⅓ of the cost for a lizard or snake to move the same distance. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that sidewinding is associated with the sand being hot.

Dit Clapper

Aubrey Victor "Dit" Clapper (February 9, 1907 – January 21, 1978) was a Canadian Hall of Fame ice hockey player, playing his entire professional career for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League. 
Clapper was the first NHL player to play twenty seasons, and one of only two to be an All-Star at both forward and defence. The right wing on the powerful "Dynamite Line"—one of the first forward lines to receive a nickname in hockey history—along with linemates Cooney Weiland and Dutch Gainor, he contributed to the breaking of several scoring records in the 1930s. Towards the end of his career, he was named player-coach of the Bruins, and held the coaching position after his retirement as a player.
Early years.
Aubrey Clapper, son of Bill Clapper, was raised in Hastings, Ontario. Clapper was given his nickname at an early age when he would lisp his name, the result coming out "Dit."
Clapper started his hockey career at age 13, playing minor hockey in Oshawa, and going on to play with the junior league Toronto Parkdale club of the Ontario Hockey Association in 1925, scoring a goal in the team's Memorial Cup run that season. The following season he turned professional, playing for the Boston Tigers of the Canadian-American Hockey League.
NHL career.
The Boston Bruins bought Clapper's contract from the Tigers in 1927. Hitherto a defenceman, Bruins' coach Art Ross decided to try Clapper at right wing, and the experiment stuck. He scored his first NHL goal - ten seconds into his first shift—in the season opener against the Chicago Black Hawks.
The following season, Ross teamed Clapper up with Cooney Weiland and Dutch Gainor to form the Dynamite Line, one of the first named forward lines in history. The Bruins won the American Division that season and went on to their first Stanley Cup championship, with Clapper scoring the winning goal in the first game of their best-of-three series with the New York Rangers. 
In the 1930 season, the league changed the passing rules, effectively eliminating offsides. The Stanley Cup champion Bruins took especial advantage, breaking many scoring records and recording the highest winning percentage the league would ever see, unsurpassed as of 2012. Leading the charge was the Dynamite Line, as Weiland led the league in scoring, Clapper finishing third and Gainor finishing ninth; Clapper's goal total of 41 was the third most in league history at that time. The Dynamite Line scored 102 of the Bruins' league record 179 goals, as many as last-place Pittsburgh managed. While Clapper scored four goals in six playoff games, the Bruins were shocked in the Stanley Cup finals by the Montreal Canadiens in their best-of-three series.
While Clapper kept his production high in the 1931 season, Gainor's scoring fell off badly, and the Dynamite Line was broken up at season's end. Clapper's 22 goals were good for eighth in the league, and he was named Second Team All-Star at right wing at year's end, the first season such All-Stars were named. The following year Clapper—with Bud Cook replacing the traded Gainor on his line with Weiland—was named team captain and again finished eighth in league scoring, but an injury-riddled Bruins' team fell into last place and out of the playoffs. While Weiland was dealt to Ottawa for the 1933 season, the Bruins purchased Montreal Maroons star Nels Stewart and paired him with Clapper to form a powerful offensive unit that led the Bruins back to a division championship.
The largest forward of his era at 6'2" and 200 lbs, Clapper was a notably peaceful player who nonetheless was involved in an unusual incident in the 1937 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Montreal Maroons. Highsticking Maroon Dave Trottier twice in the head, referee Clarence Campbell (the future NHL president) called Clapper a profane name, and Clapper knocked the referee to the ice with a single punch. Speculation was heavy that Clapper's punishment would be severe, but Campbell himself pleaded Clapper's case, stating that he felt he had provoked the Bruin into the blow; Clapper received only a $100 fine for the incident.
By 1938, Ross believed the Bruins needed an overhaul, and as part of it asked Clapper to move back to defence. Paired with perennial superstar Eddie Shore on the backline, the move proved highly successful, and Clapper was named a First Team NHL All-Star on defence in 1939, 1940 and 1941, leading the Bruins to Stanley Cup victories in 1939 and 1941.
In February 1942, Clapper suffered a severed tendon in a collision with Toronto player Bingo Kampman and was done for the season. It was feared he would be forced into retirement, but he came back next year and returned to form. During the 1944 season, Clapper broke Hooley Smith's career record for games played, holding the record until Maurice Richard surpassed him in 1957.
Player-coach.
During the 1944 season, Clapper filled in as interim coach when Art Ross took ill. In 1945 Ross retired as Bruins' coach, retaining his general manager's position, and named Clapper as player-coach, the only one in team history. Clapper retained his team captaincy until his retirement as a player in 1947, ultimately serving as team captain for longer than any NHL player until Ray Bourque surpassed his total in the 1990s.
Retirement and legacy.
Due to injuries and with his skills not what they used to be, Clapper originally retired before the start of the 1946–47 season, but returned to play in November 1946 to replace the injured Jack Crawford in the Bruins' lineup. He played only once in awhile thereafter, and retired for good on February 12, 1947. Leading the Bruins to a 10-1 victory over the New York Rangers in his final game (in which Bill Cowley broke the league career scoring record, the Bruins further announced that day that his number #5 sweater would be retired, and the Hockey Hall of Fame immediately inducted him as an Honoured Member; he was the only active player ever to be inducted into the Hall, and at the time the only living Member inducted. 
Of his prowess, Bruins goaltending legend Tiny Thompson said: "Clapper diagnosed the plays like a great infielder in baseball," said. "He put himself where the puck had to come."
He coached the Bruins for two more seasons until, unhappy with the club's performance in the 1949 playoffs against Toronto and uneasy about coaching friends with whom he had played, he resigned. Save for a single season coaching the American Hockey League's Buffalo Bisons in 1960, in which the team recorded a 33-35-4 record and failed to make the playoffs, he did not again participate in professional hockey.
Clapper ran a plumbing firm and a sporting goods store in Peterborough in retirement, while serving as a director of the Peterborough Petes of the OHA. He briefly attempted a political career, standing as a Liberal candidate for the Peterborough West riding in the 1949 federal election, losing by less than 250 votes to incumbent Progressive Conservative Gordon Fraser.
Dit Clapper died of complications from a 1973 stroke, which had left him confined to a wheelchair, on January 21, 1978. He is buried in Trent Valley Cemetery, Hastings, Ontario.
In 1983, the Bruins signed former Montreal Canadiens star Guy Lapointe, Lapointe sought to wear his customary #5 jersey, which had been retired in Clapper's honor nearly forty years before. Team general manager Harry Sinden agreed to Lapointe's request, but under protests from Clapper's family, Bruins superstar Bobby Orr and the public, Lapointe was switched to #27 after a handful of games.
In August 2012, former NHL coach Scotty Bowman, who was a young Peterborough Petes coach when Clapper served on the club's board of directors, paid tribute to Clapper. The occasion was the unveiling by Dit's daughter, Marilyn Armstrong, of a new street sign named "Dit Clapper Drive" in Hastings, Ontario.

Footprint

Footprints are shapes on the ground where people or animals walked. The foot touches the ground and at that position a footprint appears afterwards. This can happen because the ground is muddy or snowy and the foot sinks a little bit into the ground. Another possibility is that the foot is dirty or has fresh color on it. When the foot touches the ground the dirt or color remains at the ground and marks the position of contact. 
Footprints mark the way of people or animals. Hunters for example are able to follow an animal by following its footprints. Like that leaving footprints can be a big disadvantage. 
In the time of internet people also talk about digital footprints. This are not real footprint but small bits of data (for example the IP address) which enable computer professionals to follow the way of an user in the internet. This can also be a disadvantage for the user who is leaving the digital footprints.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the pope is seen as the highest clergy and as the head of the church. In short, anything the pope says in his function of head of the church is valid for the whole church. The pope has full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered: that, in brief, "the Pope enjoys, by divine institution, supreme, full, immediate, and universal power in the care of souls." This means that the situation of the pope is similar to that of an absolute monarch or the leader of a Fascist state.

Template codice_1 has been incorrectly substituted.
The Equality Act 2010 is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.
The main purpose of the Act is to combine the many Acts and Regulations, which formed the basis of anti-discrimination law in Great Britain and to try to make them easier to understand. The Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and three major statutory instruments protecting discrimination in employment on grounds of religion or belief, sexual orientation and age are the main Acts and Regulations that were combined to make the Equality Act 2010. This legislation has the same goals as the four major EU Equal Treatment Directives and tries to achieve the same things. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, gender, and sexual orientation. In the case of gender, there are special protections for pregnant women. However, the Act allows transsexual people to be barred from gender-specific services if that is "a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim". In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people. In this regard, the Equality Act 2010 did not change the law. Under s.217, with limited exceptions the Act does not apply to Northern Ireland.

Basketball in the 1988 Summer Olympics took place at the Jamsil Gymnasium in Seoul, South Korea. The United States won the gold medal in the women's competition. This repeated their performance from the 1984 tournament. In the men's tournament, the Soviet Union took home their second gold medal in the team's history for this event. Yugoslavia won the silver medal. The USA won the bronze medal. This was the last Olympic basketball tournament where NBA players were not allowed to participate. Professionals from other leagues were allowed to compete. But players from other leagues were still considered amateurs. These were also the last Olympic basketball tournaments where the Soviets fielded a team. This was because the Soviet Union broke up prior to the 1992 Games. The United States was a major favorite to win.

Proto-Sinaitic script

Proto-Sinaitic is a Middle Bronze Age script. It is known only from a few inscriptions at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai Peninsula. 
Because there are so few Proto-Sinaitic signs, little is known with certainty about the nature of the script. The script co-existed with Egyptian hieroglyphs, so it is likely that it represented true writing, but this is not certain. From the shape of the signs, Proto-Sinaitic may be an alphabet, and the ancestor of the Phoenician alphabet, from which nearly all modern alphabets descend.
There have been two major discoveries of inscriptions of the Proto-Sinaitic script. The first was in the winter of 1904–1905 in Sinai by Hilda and Flinders Petrie, dated to circa 1700–1400 BC. The second find was more recently in 1999 in Middle Egypt by John and Deborah Darnell. This is dated to the 18th century BC.
